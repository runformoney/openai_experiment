00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it, Captain?</font>

140
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Defense positions.</font>

141
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Defense positions.</font>

142
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we under attack?</font>

143
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Defense positions.</font>

144
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get around to the side.</font>

145
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Defense positions.</font>

146
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Defense positions!</font>

147
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No games.</font>

148
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you see?</font>

149
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come in. Come in.</font>

150
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over there! Look back!</font>

151
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch out!</font>

152
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">T'Challa, no!</font>

153
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one's just a boy.</font>

154
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He got kidnapped as well.</font>

155
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nakia...</font>

156
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I...</font>

157
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I wanted...
- Hey!</font>

158
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have her!
Don't move! I will shoot!</font>

159
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will shoot her right now.</font>

160
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You froze.</font>

161
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah...</font>

162
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you here?
You've ruined my mission.</font>

163
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father is dead, Nakia.</font>

164
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will be crowned king
tomorrow.</font>

165
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I wish for you
to be there.</font>

166
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carry yourselves home now.</font>

167
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

168
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And take the boy.
Get him to his people.</font>

169
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you oh.</font>

170
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will speak
nothing of this day.</font>

171
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:39,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

172
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

173
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

174
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sister Nakia...</font>

175
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My Prince...</font>

176
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we are home.</font>

177
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This never gets old.</font>

178
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Queen Mother...</font>

179
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Princess...</font>

180
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My comfort for your loss.</font>

181
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Nakia.</font>

182
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is so good
to have you back with us.</font>

183
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take her to
the River Province</font>

184
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to prepare her
for the ceremony.</font>

185
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:11,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, General.</font>

186
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he freeze?</font>

187
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like an antelope
in headlights.</font>

188
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you finished?</font>

189
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So surprised
my little sister came</font>

190
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to see me off
before our big day.</font>

191
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wish!</font>

192
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.</font>

193
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Update? No.
It worked perfectly.</font>

194
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many times
do I have to teach you?</font>

195
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just because something works</font>

196
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">doesn't mean
that it cannot be improved.</font>

197
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are teaching me?
What do you know?</font>

198
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More than you.</font>

199
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't wait to see what kind
of update you make...</font>

200
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to your ceremonial outfit.</font>

201
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shuri!</font>

202
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, Mother!</font>

203
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you
feeling today, Mama?</font>

204
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Proud.</font>

205
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.</font>

206
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is with us...</font>

207
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it is your time
to be king.</font>

208
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning.</font>

209
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can I help you?</font>

210
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just checking out
these artifacts.</font>

211
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:43,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They tell me
you're the expert.</font>

212
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah. You could say that.</font>

213
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're beautiful.</font>

214
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's this one from?</font>

215
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Bobo Ashanti tribe...</font>

216
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">present day Ghana...</font>

217
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:56,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">19th century.</font>

218
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For real?</font>

219
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about this one?</font>

220
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That one's from the Edo people
of Benin...</font>

221
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">16th century.</font>

222
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, tell me about this one.</font>

223
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also from Benin,
seventh century.</font>

224
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fula tribe, I believe.</font>

225
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah.</font>

226
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I beg your pardon?</font>

227
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was taken by
British soldiers in Benin</font>

228
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it's from Wakanda.</font>

229
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's made
out of vibranium.</font>

230
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't trip.</font>

231
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'mma take it
off your hands for you.</font>

232
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These items aren't for sale.</font>

233
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you think
your ancestors got these?</font>

234
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think they paid
a fair price?</font>

235
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or did they take it, like they
took everything else?</font>

236
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I'm going to have to</font>

237
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ask you to leave.</font>

238
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got
all this security in here</font>

239
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">watching me
ever since I walked in.</font>

240
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you ain't checking for</font>

241
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what you put in your body.</font>

242
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, mate.
Let's have it.</font>

243
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, mate. Time.</font>

244
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think she might not
be feeling too good.</font>

245
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody get some help!
Come here!</font>

246
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call a doctor, please!
Please, somebody, come help!</font>

247
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Medical emergency
right away</font>

248
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the West African Exhibit,
please, right away.</font>

249
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look out.</font>

250
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Step back, please.
Step back. Thank you.</font>

251
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.</font>

252
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna take a break.</font>

253
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's give the lady
some space, please.</font>

254
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Step back,
please, gents.</font>

255
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Step back, please.</font>

256
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, come here.</font>

257
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here. It's okay.</font>

258
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, all right?</font>

259
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?</font>

260
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because it's better to leave</font>

261
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the crime scene
more spread out.</font>

262
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makes us look like amateurs.</font>

263
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now then,
let's see if you know</font>

264
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what you're talking about.</font>

265
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's just a taste.</font>

266
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're gonna be a rich boy.
- You better sell that quick.</font>

267
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's already sold!</font>

268
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:40,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever you try,</font>

269
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Wakandans'll
probably show up.</font>

270
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That'll make my day.</font>

271
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can kill two birds
with one stone.</font>

272
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?</font>

273
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah, I'm just feeling it.</font>

274
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Onward!</font>

275
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Onward!</font>

276
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, Zuri...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not ready.</font>

375
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you not prepared</font>

376
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:51,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be king your whole life?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you not trained
and studied,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is not
what I am talking about.</font>

380
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not ready
to be without you.</font>

381
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A man who has not prepared

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me how to
best protect Wakanda.</font>

387
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to be
a great king, <i>Baba.</i></font>

388
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like you.</font>

389
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to struggle.</font>

390
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you'll need to
surround yourself</font>

391
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with people you trust.</font>

392
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a good man
with a good heart.</font>

393
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's hard
for a good man to be king.</font>

394
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Breathe.</font>

395
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">T'Challa, breathe.</font>

396
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Breathe.</font>

397
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was there.</font>

398
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:10,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was there. My father.</font>

399
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just one?</font>

400
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come home, Nakia.</font>

401
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm right here.</font>

402
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay.</font>

403
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:43,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I came to support you
and to honor your father...</font>

404
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I can't stay.</font>

405
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found my calling out there.</font>

406
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.</font>

407
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't be happy here...</font>

408
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.</font>

409
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would you have
Wakanda do about it?</font>

410
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Share what we have.</font>

411
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could provide aid...</font>

412
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:06,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and access to technology</font>

413
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and refuge
to those who need it.</font>

414
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Other countries do it,
we could do it better.</font>

415
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:15,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are not like
these other countries, Nakia.</font>

416
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If the world found out
what we truly are...</font>

417
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what we possess...</font>

418
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we could lose our way of life.</font>

419
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wakanda is strong enough
to help others</font>

420
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and protect ourselves
at the same time.</font>

421
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.</font>

422
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.</font>

423
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ah! See, you admit it!
- If that's what I wanted.</font>

424
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that him?</font>

425
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?</font>

426
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

427
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see Nakia is back.</font>

428
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys going to work it out?</font>

429
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">T'Challa...</font>

430
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what's wrong?</font>

431
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nakia thinks
we should be doing more.</font>

432
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More, like what?</font>

433
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Foreign aid, refugee programs.</font>

434
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You let the refugees in...</font>

435
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they bring their problems
with them.</font>

436
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then Wakanda
is like everywhere else.</font>

437
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now if you said
you wanted me and my men...</font>

438
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to go out there
and clean up the world,</font>

439
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I'll be all for it.</font>

440
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But waging war
on other countries</font>

441
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has never been our way.</font>

442
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, too, huh?</font>

443
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bast! We're in trouble.</font>

444
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My King.</i></font>

445
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:47,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My love.</i></font>

446
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:51,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You will never guess who just
popped up on our radar.</i></font>

447
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A misidentified
Wakandan artifact...</font>

448
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.</font>

449
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have learned
Ulysses Klaue...</font>

450
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...</font>

451
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in South Korea...</font>

452
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">tomorrow night.</font>

453
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:15,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Klaue has escaped our pursuits
for almost 30 years.</font>

454
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:20,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not capturing him is, perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.</font>

455
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.</font>

456
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:28,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.</font>

457
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:29,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need a king.</font>

458
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My parents were killed
when he attacked.</font>

459
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a day goes by
when I do not think</font>

460
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about what Klaue took from us.</font>

461
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From me.</font>

462
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's too great
an opportunity to pass.</font>

463
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take me with you.</font>

464
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll take him down together,
side by side.</font>

465
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you here
protecting the border.</font>

466
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I ask...</font>

467
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you kill him
where he stands...</font>

468
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or you bring him back to us.</font>

469
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have my word.</font>

470
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will bring him back.</font>

471
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will proceed
with the mission.</font>

472
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:52,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My King!</font>

473
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it. Stop it.</font>

474
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've already sent a car ahead
to Busan for you.</font>

475
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you taking with you
to Korea?</font>

476
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okoye.</font>

477
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Nakia as well.</font>

478
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?</font>

479
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:13,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

480
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:15,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll be fine.</font>

481
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides, you'll be on call
should we need backup.</font>

482
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

483
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have great things
to show you, Brother.</font>

484
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here are your communication
devices for Korea.</font>

485
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unlimited range,</font>

486
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">also equipped with
audio surveillance system.</font>

487
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check these out.</font>

488
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remote access Kimoyo Beads.</font>

489
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.</font>

490
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah.</font>

491
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what are these?</font>

492
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:45,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The real question is
what are those?</font>

493
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you have
your toes out in my lab?</font>

494
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, you don't like
my royal sandals?</font>

495
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:53,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to go old school
for my first day.</font>

496
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet the Elders loved that.</font>

497
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try them on.</font>

498
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fully automated.</font>

499
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like the old American movie
<i>Baba</i> used to watch.</font>

500
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

501
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I made them
completely sound absorbent.</font>

502
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:11,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Interesting.</font>

503
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess what I call them.</font>

504
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sneakers.</font>

505
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you...</font>

506
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never mind.</font>

507
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're going to take
on Klaue...</font>

508
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:26,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'll need the best
the design group has to offer.</font>

509
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:27,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exhibit A.</font>

510
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My design.
- Old tech.</font>

511
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Old?
- Functional, but old.</font>

512
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Hey, people are shooting
at me.</font>

513
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Wait, let me put on
my helmet."</font>

514
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enough.</font>

515
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, look at these.</font>

516
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you like that one?</font>

517
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tempting.</font>

518
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the idea
is to not be noticed.</font>

519
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one.</font>

520
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now tell it to go on.</font>

521
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh!</font>

522
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.</font>

523
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strike it.</font>

524
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Anywhere?
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

525
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not that hard, genius!</font>

526
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.</font>

527
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I invite you to my lab,</font>

528
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you just
kick things around?</font>

529
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe you should make it
a little stronger.</font>

530
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

531
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute.</font>

532
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:35,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The nanites
absorb the kinetic energy...</font>

533
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and hold it in place
for redistribution.</font>

534
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very nice.</font>

535
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strike it again
in the same spot.</font>

536
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're recording?</font>

537
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For research purposes.</font>

538
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Delete that footage.</font>

539
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:18,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way.</font>

540
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bast willing,
this will go quickly...</font>

541
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I can get this ridiculous
thing off my head.</font>

542
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:30,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks nice.
Just whip it back and forth.</font>

543
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? It's a disgrace.</font>

544
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello Sophia.</font>

545
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good to see you.</font>

546
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are these two?</font>

547
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friends from Kenya.</font>

548
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very deep pockets.
They're good.</font>

549
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good for trouble...</font>

550
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...like you?</font>

551
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you!</font>

552
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spread out.</font>

553
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:28,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The buyer
is likely already here.</font>

554
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The woman outside.</font>

00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You savages didn't deserve it.</font>

694
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, mercy, King. Mercy.</font>

695
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every breath you take
is mercy from me.</font>

696
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">King!</font>

697
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:36,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The world watches.</font>

698
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Guys.
Let's go, huh?</font>

699
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:45,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

700
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:01,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

701
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see you! I can.
I can see you.</font>

702
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So this is a big mess, huh?</font>

703
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:19,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I figured we could go
good cop, bad cop.</font>

704
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in.</font>

705
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:25,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't let him
talk to Klaue alone.</font>

706
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:31,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better to let him talk to
Klaue alone for 5 minutes</font>

707
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than to make a scene here.</font>

708
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After your questioning,</font>

709
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we will take him back
to Wakanda with us.</font>

710
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:41,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No.
Look, I like you, a lot.</font>

711
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:44,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.</font>

712
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I'm doing you guys
a favor</font>

713
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:47,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by letting you
even be in here.</font>

714
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he touches you again,</font>

715
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to impale him
to this desk.</font>

716
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:57,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does she speak English?</font>

717
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When she wants to.</font>

718
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:01,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh.</font>

719
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going in.</font>

720
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I'm done,
you guys are up.</font>

721
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Agent Ross.
- Yeah?</font>

722
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do appreciate your help
in Busan.</font>

723
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:12,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see that?</font>

724
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called diplomacy.</font>

725
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome.</font>

726
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:20,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okoye.</font>

727
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:21,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Play nice.</font>

728
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Americans.</font>

729
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, you really shouldn't
trust the Wakandans.</font>

730
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm much more your speed.</font>

731
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:40,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't trust anybody,
not in this job.</font>

732
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:43,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.</font>

733
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where'd you get that?</font>

734
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.</font>

735
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I can get you one,
if you like.</font>

736
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you give me the name
of your supplier,</font>

737
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'll ask them.</font>

738
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's right outside.</font>

739
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you
ask him yourself?</font>

740
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? T'Challa?</font>

741
00:55:57,229 --> 00:56:00,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?</font>

742
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:01,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bingo.</font>

743
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:06,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you actually know
about Wakanda?</font>

744
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:07,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

745
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shepherds, textiles,
cool outfits.</font>

746
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It's all a front.</i></font>

747
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:15,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Explorers searched for it
for centuries.</i></font>

748
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:18,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>El Dorado, the Golden City.</i></font>

749
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They thought they could
find it in South America...</i></font>

750
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:23,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it was in Africa
the whole time.</font>

751
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A technological marvel.</font>

752
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All because it was built
on a mound</font>

753
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the most valuable metal
known to man.</font>

754
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Isipho,</i> they call it.
The gift.</font>

755
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vibranium.</font>

756
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.</font>

757
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:38,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not just a metal.</font>

758
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They sew it
into their clothes.</font>

759
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It powers their city,
their tech...</font>

760
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">their weapons.</font>

761
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:47,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weapons?</font>

762
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:48,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

763
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:51,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.</font>

764
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:52,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a nice fairy tale,</font>

765
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but Wakanda is
a third world country...</font>

766
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you stole
all their vibranium.</font>

767
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:58,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I stole...</font>

768
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of it?</font>

769
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took a tiny piece of it.</font>

770
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They have
a mountain full of it.</font>

771
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They've been mining it
for thousands of years...</i></font>

772
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and they still haven't
scratched the surface.</i></font>

773
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:16,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm the only outsider
who's seen it</i></font>

774
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and got out of there alive.</i></font>

775
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>If you don't believe me,</i></font>

776
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:23,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>you ask your friend
what his suit is made of.</i></font>

777
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:26,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What his claws are made of.</font>

778
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father told the UN...</font>

779
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that Klaue stole
all the vibranium you had.</font>

780
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now he's telling me
you have more.</font>

781
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you believe the word</font>

782
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of an arms dealer
strapped to a chair?</font>

783
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:19,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is that?</font>

784
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back there.</font>

785
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much more are you hiding?</font>

786
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something is happening
out back.</font>

787
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down!</font>

788
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand down!</font>

789
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:56,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover!</font>

790
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grenade!</font>

791
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see you took your time,
didn't you?</font>

792
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My King!</font>

793
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:29,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My King.</font>

794
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:30,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nakia.</font>

795
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just jumped in front of me.</font>

796
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think
he'll make it here.</font>

797
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:40,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It hit his spine.</font>

798
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:45,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me a Kimoyo Bead.</font>

799
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This will stabilize him
for now.</font>

800
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:00,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give him to us.</font>

801
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:03,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can save him.</font>

802
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our mission
was to bring back Klaue.</font>

803
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We failed.</font>

804
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.</font>

805
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:23,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do we justify
bringing him into our borders?</font>

806
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:24,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He took a bullet for me.</font>

807
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was his choice.</font>

808
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So now we are just supposed to
let him die?</font>

809
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let us consider
that we heal him.</font>

810
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is his duty to report back
to his country.</font>

811
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And as king, it is your duty
to protect ours.</font>

812
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:40,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm well aware of
my duties, General.</font>

813
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:44,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot just let him die...</font>

814
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">knowing we can save him.</font>

815
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where exactly
are we taking him?</font>

816
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:00,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great! Another broken
white boy for us to fix.</font>

817
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is going to be fun.</font>

818
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He will live.</font>

819
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">W'Kabi is here.</font>

820
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on, brother?
Where is Klaue?</font>

821
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not here.</font>

822
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He slipped through our hands.</font>

823
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:38,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Slipped"?</font>

824
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:44,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For 30 years, your father was
in power and did nothing.</font>

825
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:47,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With you,
I thought it'd be different.</font>

826
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's more of the same.</font>

827
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get going, boss.</font>

828
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You always sell to the CIA?</font>

829
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I sell to the highest bidder.</font>

830
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But don't you worry.
When I get back to Joburg...</font>

831
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:20,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I lay low for a bit,</font>

832
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll make sure
both you guys get paid.</font>

833
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I ain't worried
about the money, bro.</font>

834
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you good for it.</font>

835
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On our way back,
just drop us off in Wakanda.</font>

836
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:28,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want to
go there, boy.</font>

837
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:30,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I do.</font>

838
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:33,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop it!</font>

839
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or your little
Bonnie and Clyde routine</font>

840
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:37,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ends today.</font>

841
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your gun down now!</font>

842
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:41,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

843
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry, Erik.
- It's gonna be okay.</font>

844
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really want to go
to Wakanda?</font>

845
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're savages.</font>

846
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:21,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what they do
to people like us.</font>

847
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:22,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't worried
about no brand.</font>

848
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:24,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check these out.</font>

849
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Each one is for a kill.</font>

850
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can scar yourself as much
as you'd like.</font>

851
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To them,
you'll just be an outsider.</font>

852
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.</font>

853
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:45,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, to think I saw you
as some crazy American.</font>

854
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:00,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave us!</font>

855
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:15,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So your mission did not go
as planned.</font>

856
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:20,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened
to my uncle N'Jobu?</font>

857
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father told me
he disappeared.</font>

858
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was a man today...</font>

859
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:31,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wearing a ring
identical to this one.</font>

860
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is not possible.</font>

861
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:38,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!</font>

862
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My grandfather's ring!</font>

863
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:42,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not tell me
what is possible.</font>

864
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me the truth!</font>

865
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some truths...</font>

866
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:56,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are too much to bear,
T'Challa.</font>

867
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is not your choice
to make.</font>

868
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:01,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to him?</font>

869
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promised the king
to say nothing.</font>

870
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am your king now!</font>

871
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your uncle took...</font>

872
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:28,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a War Dog assignment
in America.</font>

873
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:32,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father...</font>

874
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">placed me there...</font>

875
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:36,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>to observe...</i></font>

876
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">unbeknownst to him.</font>

877
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:43,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.</font>

878
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They had a child.</font>

879
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hardships he saw there...</font>

880
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">radicalized your uncle.</font>

881
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:55,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I observed
for as long as I could.</font>

882
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their leaders
have been assassinated.</font>

883
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Communities flooded with drugs
and weapons.</font>

884
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:03,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are overly policed
and incarcerated.</font>

885
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All over the planet...</font>

886
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:06,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">our people suffer because</font>

887
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:08,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they don't have the tools
to fight back.</font>

888
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:11,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With vibranium weapons,</font>

889
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they could overthrow
every country...</font>

890
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Wakanda could
rule them all</font>

891
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:16,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the right way.</font>

892
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:19,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He knew your father
would not support this.</font>

893
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:23,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, your uncle betrayed us.</font>

894
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

895
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:28,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He helped Klaue
steal the vibranium.</i></font>

896
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.</font>

897
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will return home
at once...</font>

898
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where you will face
the Council...</font>

899
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:38,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and inform them
of your crimes.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He drew his weapon
on me.</i></font>

901
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:42,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Your father
killed his own brother...</i></font>

903
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:05,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to save my life.</font>

904
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:12,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speak nothing of this.</font>

905
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the child?</font>

906
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We left him.</font>

907
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:33,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had to...</font>

908

<font face="Comic Sans MS">maintain...</font>

909
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:38,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the lie.</font>

910
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this?</font>

911
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a little gift.</font>

912
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

913
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, where am I?</font>

914
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't scare me like that,
colonizer!</font>

915
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?
My name is Everett.</font>

916
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:31,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I know. Everett Ross...</font>

917
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:34,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">former air force pilot
and now CIA.</font>

918
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

919
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, is this Wakanda?</font>

920
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:44,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's Kansas.</font>

921
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long ago was Korea?</font>

922
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yesterday.</font>

923
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think so.</font>

924
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.</font>

925
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:56,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They do here.</font>

926
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:59,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But not by magic,
by technology.</font>

927
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:07,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.</font>

928
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These train things...</font>

929
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:35,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's magnetic levitation,
right?</font>

930
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:36,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Obviously.</font>

931
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:41,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Obviously, but I've never
seen it this efficient.</font>

932
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The light panels,
what are they?</font>

933
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Sonic stabilizers.
- Sonic what?</i></font>

934
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:49,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In its raw form...</font>

935
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">vibranium is too dangerous</font>

936
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:53,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be transported
at that speed...</font>

937
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:56,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I developed a way
to temporarily deactivate it.</font>

938
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There's vibranium
on those trains?</i></font>

939
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's vibranium
all around us.</font>

940
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how I healed you.</font>

941
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Where is T'Challa?</i></font>

942
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,345

943
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,764

946
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:22,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

947
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:25,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We need to find your brother!</i></font>

949
01:11:27,575 --> 01:11:28,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An outsider?</font>

950
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:30,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No, a Wakandan.</i></font>

951
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not a Wakandan.</font>

952
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:35,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's one of ours.</font>

953
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He killed his own brother...</font>

954
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and left a child behind...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">with nothing.</font>

956
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of king...</font>

957
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:02,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of man does that?</font>

958
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No man is perfect.</font>

959
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:06,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not even your father.</font>

01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:29,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.</font>

966
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:35,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get to decide what kind of
king you are going to be.</font>

967
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:44,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Brother, you need to
get here now!</i></font>

968
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Erik Stevens.</font>

969
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Graduated Annapolis age 19...</font>

970
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:51,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">MIT for grad school.</font>

971
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:53,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan...</font>

972
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where he wrapped up
confirmed kills,</font>

973
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:56,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like it was a video game.</font>

974
01:12:56,664 --> 01:12:58,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Started calling him
Killmonger.</font>

975
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:01,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.</font>

976
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:02,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They will drop off the grid...</font>

977
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so they can
commit assassinations</font>

978
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:05,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and take down governments.</font>

979
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:09,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he reveal anything
about his identity?</font>

980
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has
a War Dog tattoo...</font>

981
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:14,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we have no record of him.</font>

982
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this man Wakandan or not?</font>

983
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell us what is going on.</font>

984
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:46,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speak.</font>

985
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speak.</font>

986
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:52,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm standing in your house...</font>

987
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">serving justice to a man</font>

988
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who stole your vibranium
and murdered your people.</font>

989
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:58,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Justice your king
couldn't deliver.</font>

990
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:06,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care
that you brought Klaue.</font>

991
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:09,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only reason I don't kill you
where you stand</font>

992
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is because I know who you are.</font>

993
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:14,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, what do you want?</font>

994
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:17,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want the throne.</font>

995
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My goodness.</font>

996
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Y'all sittin' up here
comfortable.</font>

997
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must feel good.</font>

998
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's about 2 billion people</font>

999
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:30,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all over the world
that looks like us.</font>

1000
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But their lives
are a lot harder.</font>

1001
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wakanda has the tools
to liberate 'em all.</font>

1002
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what tools are those?</font>

1003
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vibranium. Your weapons.</font>

1004
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:45,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.</font>

1005
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:49,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is not our way to be judge,
jury and executioner...</font>

1006
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:51,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for people
who are not our own.</font>

1007
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:53,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not your own?</font>

1008
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:56,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But didn't life start
right here on this continent?</font>

1009
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So ain't all people
your people?</font>

1010
01:14:57,785 --> 01:15:01,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.</font>

1011
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it is my responsibility</font>

1012
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to make sure
our people are safe...</font>

1013
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:08,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that vibranium
does not fall</font>

1014
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">into the hands
of a person like you.</font>

1015
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:11,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mmm...
- Son.</font>

1016
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:14,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have entertained
this charlatan for too long.</font>

1017

1018
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I ain't
requesting nothing.</font>

- You're Erik Stevens.</font>

1020
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:24,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An American black operative.</font>

1021
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A mercenary
nicknamed Killmonger.</font>

01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:27,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's who you are.</font>

01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:29,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not my name, Princess.</font>

1024
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:31,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ask me, King.</font>

1025
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:32,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1026
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:34,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ask me.</font>

1027
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take him away.</font>

1028
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:40,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

1029
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am N'Jadaka,
son of Prince N'Jobu.</font>

in his chest!</font>

1033
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:51,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.</font>

01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:53,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're lying!</font>

- I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1037
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:02,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The descendent of N'Jobu.</font>

1038
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:04,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Auntie.</font>

1039
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:09,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm exercising my blood right</font>

1040
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,477

for the mantles of king...</font>

1043
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As the son of Prince N'Jobu,</font>

01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The challenge will take weeks
to prepare.</font>

1047
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:30,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weeks? I don't need weeks.</font>

1048
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:32,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.</font>

1049
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:35,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And somebody to get me
outta these chains.</font>

1050
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:42,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">T'Challa,
what do you know of this?</font>

1051
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I accept your challenge.</font>

1052
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll never beat T'Challa.</font>

1053
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:07,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He should've just come
to the first challenge</font>

1054
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:09,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and gotten it over with.</font>

01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:17,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The king
will now have the strength</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the Black Panther
stripped away.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Agent Ross?</font>

1058
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.</font>

01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:07,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Throw down your weapons,</font>

1061
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:09,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we can handle this
another way.</font>

1062

01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:56,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah. I'm your king.</font>

1101
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:58,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No! No!
- We have to go now!</font>

1102
01:21:58,705 --> 01:22:00,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Queen Mother, let's go!</font>

1103
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Queen Mother and Shuri,
they are safe?</font>

1104
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:40,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1105
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:41,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1106
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:44,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should get
to them immediately.</font>

1107
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:46,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot.</font>

1108
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:46,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1109
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:48,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Though my heart is with you.</font>

1110
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:52,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We cannot turn over
our nation to a man</font>

1111
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:54,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who showed up here
only hours ago.</font>

1112
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:55,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is of royal blood.</font>

1113
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:57,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He killed T'Challa!
- In ritual combat.</font>

1114
01:22:57,723 --> 01:22:59,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does that really matter?</font>

1115
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:05,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are the greatest warrior
Wakanda has.</font>

1116
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:09,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.</font>

1117
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:10,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Overthrow?</font>

1118
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:12,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nakia!</font>

1119
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:16,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!</font>

1120
01:23:18,619 --> 01:23:23,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.</font>

1121
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:25,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you loyal to?</font>

1122
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:30,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I loved him.</font>

1123
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:34,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I loved my country, too.</font>

1124
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:36,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you serve your country.</font>

1125
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:39,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I save my country.</font>

1126
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:49,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong?</font>

1127
01:23:49,983 --> 01:23:51,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The king is dead.</font>

1128
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come with me,
unless you want to join him.</font>

1129
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:16,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First <i>Baba.</i></font>

1130
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:19,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now my brother.</font>

1131
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:24,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mama, we didn't
even get to bury him.</font>

1132
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:35,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's me.
- Nakia. Who is this man?</font>

1133
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:37,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.</font>

1134
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:39,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Okoye?</font>

1135
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:40,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okoye is not coming.</font>

1136
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.</font>

1137
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:50,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait here.</font>

1138
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:56,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What has happened
to our Wakanda?</font>

1139
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...</font>

1140
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:04,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to give you the powers
of the Black Panther...</font>

1141
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:07,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.</font>

1142
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:45,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did I tell you
about going into my things?</font>

1143
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:46,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm?</font>

1144
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:55,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you find?</font>

1145
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your home.</font>

1146
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:02,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gave you a key hoping that
you might see it someday.</font>

1147
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. The sunsets there</font>

1148
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:08,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are the most beautiful
in the world.</font>

1149
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I fear you still may not
be welcome.</font>

1150
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:16,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

1151
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They will say you are lost.</font>

1152
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm right here.</font>

1153
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:29,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No tears for me?</font>

1154
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:35,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody dies.</font>

1155
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:39,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just life around here.</font>

1156
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, look at what
I have done.</font>

1157
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:49,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should've taken you back
long ago.</font>

1158
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:54,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Instead, we are both
abandoned here.</font>

1159
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:02,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe your home
is the one that's lost.</font>

1160
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:06,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why they can't find us.</font>

1161
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:16,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Breathe!
Breathe, My King, breathe.</font>

1162
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:18,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.</font>

1163
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:37,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Heart-Shaped Herb
did that?</font>

1164
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:41,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This all of it?</font>

1165
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:43,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. So when it comes time
for another king,</font>

1166
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:44,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we will be ready.</font>

1167
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:46,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Another king?</font>

1168
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:50,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, go ahead
and burn all that.</font>

1169
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:53,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My King, we cannot do that.
It is our tradition...</font>

1170
01:28:57,374 --> 01:29:00,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I tell you to do
something, I mean that shit.</font>

1171
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Burn it all!</font>

1172
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, where I'm from...</font>

1173
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when black folks
started revolutions,</font>

1174
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:01,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they never had
the firepower...</font>

1175
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:03,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or the resources
to fight their oppressors.</font>

1176
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:05,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where was Wakanda?</font>

1177
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:09,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm?</font>

1178
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, all that ends today.</font>

1179
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:16,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.</font>

1180
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:18,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Already in place.</font>

1181
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:20,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know how colonizers think.</font>

1182
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:23,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we're gonna use their own
strategy against 'em.</font>

1183
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:26,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our War Dogs.</font>

1184
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:29,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world...</font>

1185
01:30:30,008 --> 01:30:32,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.</font>

1186
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:34,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And their children.</font>

1187
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:36,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And anyone else
who takes their side.</font>

1188
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time they know
the truth about us!</font>

1189
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:40,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're warriors!</font>

1190
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:43,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.</font>

1191
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:48,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.</font>

1192
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:52,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wakanda has survived
for so long...</font>

1193
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:55,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.</font>

1194
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:58,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wakanda survived
in the past this way, yes.</font>

1195
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:02,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the world is changing,
General.</font>

1196
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:06,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elders, it is getting smaller.</font>

1197
01:31:06,544 --> 01:31:08,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The outside world
is catching up...</font>

1198
01:31:08,588 --> 01:31:10,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and soon it will be
the conquerors</font>

1199
01:31:10,674 --> 01:31:12,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or the conquered.</font>

1200
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd rather be the former.</font>

1201
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:21,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.</font>

1202
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:24,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So where are we
going again?</i></font>

1203
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:25,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We're taking
the Heart-Shaped Herb</i></font>

1204
01:31:26,022 --> 01:31:27,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>to Jabariland.</i></font>

1205
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:28,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heart-Shaped Herb?
What is that?</font>

1206
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:31,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.</font>

1207
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:34,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's what made T'Challa
so strong.</font>

1208
01:31:34,698 --> 01:31:35,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nakia.</font>

1209
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like this.</font>

1210
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:43,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Herb belongs to us.</font>

1211
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:47,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We may be creating
a bigger monster with M'Baku.</font>

1212
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:57,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nakia, you should
take it yourself.</font>

1213
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:01,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am a spy with no army.</font>

1214
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:04,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't stand a chance.</font>

1215
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:07,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll go.</font>

1216
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:15,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, boy.</font>

1217
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:22,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

1218
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:25,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look down. Stay calm.</font>

1219
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:26,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shuri.</font>

1220
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:28,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look down.</font>

1221
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:05,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My son...</font>

1222
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:10,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was murdered in ritual combat.</font>

1223
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Were the odds fair?
- Yes, but...</font>

1224
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:14,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it was less a murder
than a defeat.</font>

1225
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:16,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do not rub our noses in it!
- Silence!</font>

1226
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:20,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I make
the pronouncements here, girl.</font>

1227
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:23,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, uh, Your Highness,
the new king is a U.S...</font>

1228
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:27,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The new king...</font>

1229
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:37,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You cannot talk!</font>

1230
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:38,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One more word,</font>

1231
01:33:38,905 --> 01:33:41,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I will feed you
to my children.</font>

1232
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:47,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm kidding.
We are vegetarians.</font>

1233
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:58,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great Gorilla M'Baku...</font>

1234
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:03,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this is why we are here.</font>

1235
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To offer this to you.</font>

1236
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:09,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An outsider
sits on our throne.</font>

1237
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only you can help us stop him.</font>

1238
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:30,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come with me.</font>

1239
01:34:47,182 --> 01:34:49,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Impossible!</font>

1240
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:56,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he breathing?</font>

1241
01:34:56,316 --> 01:34:59,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's in a coma.
Barely clinging to life.</font>

1242
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:01,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>One of our fishermen found him</i></font>

1243
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:02,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>at the edge
of the river border.</i></font>

1244
01:35:02,989 --> 01:35:04,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He brought him to me.</i></font>

1245
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:06,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you have him
in the snow?</font>

1246
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:07,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is the only thing
keeping him</font>

1247
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:08,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from joining the ancestors.</font>

1248
01:35:08,828 --> 01:35:11,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.</font>

1249
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:13,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take him.
He'll be dead in seconds.</font>

1250
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:16,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nakia, the Herb.</font>

1251
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:35,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I call upon the ancestors.</font>

1252
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I call upon Bast.</font>

1253
01:35:38,191 --> 01:35:41,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am here
with my son, T'Challa.</font>

1254
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:43,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heal him.</font>

1255
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:58,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!</font>

1256
01:35:58,711 --> 01:35:59,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1257
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:13,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Praise the ancestors.</font>

1258
01:36:13,559 --> 01:36:14,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Praise the ancestors.</font>

1259
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:17,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Praise the ancestors.</font>

1260
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:19,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Praise the ancestors.</font>

1261
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wake up, T'Challa.</font>

1262
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:24,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wake up.</i></font>

1263
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:28,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My son.</font>

1264
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:37,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The time has come
for you to come home...</font>

1265
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:40,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and be reunited with me.</font>

1266
01:36:51,389 --> 01:36:52,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

1267
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:58,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you
bring the boy home?</font>

1268
01:36:59,772 --> 01:37:01,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why, <i>Baba?</i></font>

1269
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:04,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He...</font>

1270
01:37:05,278 --> 01:37:08,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was the truth
I chose to omit.</font>

1271
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:12,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were wrong to abandon him.</font>

1272
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:14,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I chose my people.</font>

1273
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:17,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I chose Wakanda.</font>

1274
01:37:17,915 --> 01:37:19,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our future depended...</font>

1275
01:37:19,959 --> 01:37:21,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were wrong!</font>

1276
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:23,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of you were wrong!</font>

1277
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:27,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!</font>

1278
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:32,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We let the fear
of our discovery</font>

1279
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:34,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">stop us from doing
what is right!</font>

1280
01:37:35,892 --> 01:37:37,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more!</font>

1281
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:44,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot stay here with you.</font>

1282
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:50,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.</font>

1283
01:37:51,324 --> 01:37:54,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is a monster
of our own making.</font>

1284
01:37:56,037 --> 01:37:59,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must take the mantle back.
I must!</font>

1285
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:04,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must right these wrongs.</font>

1286
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:16,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have a blanket?</font>

1287
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:21,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Killmonger
has the full support</font>

1288
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of our military.</font>

1289
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:26,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he burned the garden
of the Heart-Shaped Herb.</font>

1290
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:28,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course he did.</font>

1291
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:30,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what he was
trained to do.</font>

1292
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His unit used to work
with the CIA</font>

1293
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to destabilize
foreign countries.</font>

1294
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:36,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They would always strike
at transitions of power...</font>

1295
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:39,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like an election year,
or the death of a monarch.</font>

1296
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get control of government,
the military...</font>

1297
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:43,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Our resources.
- Right.</font>

1298
01:38:45,086 --> 01:38:46,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Great Mound.</font>

1299
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:47,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our vibranium,
all of my designs.</font>

1300
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:50,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He will send our weapons
all over the world.</font>

1301
01:38:54,095 --> 01:38:56,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must get them
out of Wakanda safely.</font>

1302
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:57,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- What about you?</font>

1303
01:38:58,474 --> 01:39:00,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The challenge
will have to continue.</font>

1304
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:03,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">T'Challa, we will not
leave Wakanda.</font>

1305
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:06,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is my duty
to keep you safe.</font>

1306
01:39:06,232 --> 01:39:08,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he gets control
of our technology,</font>

1307
01:39:08,818 --> 01:39:10,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">nowhere will be safe.</font>

1308
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:32,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Black Panther lives.</font>

1309
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:35,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when he fights
for the fate of Wakanda...</font>

1310
01:39:35,928 --> 01:39:38,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will be right there
beside him.</font>

1311
01:39:39,599 --> 01:39:40,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As will I.</font>

1312
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:42,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm in, too.</font>

1313
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:46,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? You're gonna need
all the help you can get.</font>

1314
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:51,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you done?</font>

1315
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:54,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you done?</font>

1316
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:58,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could you give me
and Lord M'Baku a moment?</font>

1317
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:08,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1318
01:40:09,295 --> 01:40:11,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I owed you a great debt.</font>

1319
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:13,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A life for a life.</font>

1320
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:15,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Consider it paid.</font>

1321
01:40:16,302 --> 01:40:18,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please allow my mother
to stay here.</font>

1322
01:40:19,305 --> 01:40:22,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.</font>

1323
01:40:23,392 --> 01:40:26,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I could use
an army as well.</font>

1324
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:28,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet you could.</font>

1325
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:30,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But no.</font>

1326
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:34,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will give no Jabari lives
towards your cause.</font>

1327
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:36,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is our cause.</font>

1328
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:39,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It is for all of us.
- Oh, us?</font>

1329
01:40:39,408 --> 01:40:41,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Us? You are the first king
to come here in centuries...</font>

1330
01:40:41,827 --> 01:40:45,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now you speak of "us"?</font>

1331
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:49,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot speak for past kings.</font>

1332
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:53,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But an enemy sits
on the throne right now.</font>

1333
01:40:53,422 --> 01:40:56,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We both know the power
of vibranium.</font>

1334
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:59,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Killmonger
gains control of it,</font>

1335
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:01,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who do you think
he will come for next?</font>

1336
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:12,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will not help you.</font>

1337
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:41,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything is on schedule.</font>

1338
01:41:42,054 --> 01:41:43,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have the spies been alerted?</font>

1339
01:41:43,389 --> 01:41:45,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Some resistance
to our new mission.</font>

1340
01:41:45,891 --> 01:41:47,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the War Dogs in London,</font>

1341
01:41:47,476 --> 01:41:49,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">New York and Hong Kong
are standing by.</font>

1342
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:52,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll strike there first.</font>

1343
01:41:52,732 --> 01:41:54,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The others'll come around.</font>

1344
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:56,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this.</font>

1345
01:41:56,235 --> 01:41:57,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A handheld sonic cannon,</font>

1346
01:41:57,403 --> 01:41:58,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">powerful enough
to stop a tank...</font>

1347
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:00,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">untraceable by
metal detectors.</font>

1348
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:02,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we got thousands of them.</font>

1349
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:08,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The world's gonna find out
exactly who we are.</font>

1350
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:40,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He lives.</font>

1351
01:42:44,867 --> 01:42:46,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N'Jadaka!</font>

1352
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:49,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wassup?</font>

1353
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:51,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never yielded!</font>

1354
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:55,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And as you can see,
I am not dead!</font>

1355
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All that challenge shit
is over with!</font>

1356
01:42:58,339 --> 01:42:59,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the king now!</font>

1357
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:01,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get those planes in the air!
Carry out the mission!</font>

1358
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:11,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shuri, now.

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go!
Come on, Ross!</font>

1360
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:20,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">W'Kabi, man, kill this clown.</font>

1361
01:43:21,737 --> 01:43:24,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">W'Kabi, the challenge
is not complete.</font>

1362
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:30,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What will we do?</font>

1363
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:32,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Border Tribe!</font>
