<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's a fair. I'm gonna try my luck.</font>

138
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As who, Steve from Ohio?</font>

139
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:39,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll catch you.
Or worse, they'll actually take you.</font>

140
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:41,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I know
you don't think I can do this.</font>

141
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't a back alley, Steve. It's war.</font>

142
00:13:43,618 --> 00:13:45,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I know it's a war.
- Why are you so keen to fight?</font>

143
00:13:45,486 --> 00:13:47,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There are so many important jobs.
- What do you want me to do?</font>

144
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:49,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Collect scrap metal
in my little red wagon?</font>

145
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:51,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes. Why not?
- I'm not gonna sit in a factory, Bucky.</font>

146
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bucky, come on.
There are men laying down their lives.</font>

147
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:56,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got no right to do any less than them.</font>

148
00:13:56,965 --> 00:13:59,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what you don't understand.
This isn't about me.</font>

149
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:03,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. 'Cause you got nothing to prove.</font>

150
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:08,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Sarge! Are we going dancing?</font>

151
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:11,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, we are.</font>

152
00:14:17,785 --> 00:14:20,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't do anything stupid until I get back.</font>

153
00:14:20,121 --> 00:14:21,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can I?</font>

154
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:23,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're taking all the stupid with you.</font>

155
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're a punk.
- Jerk.</font>

156
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:31,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be careful.</font>

157
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:36,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't win the war till I get there!</font>

158
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:44,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, girls.
They're playing our song.</font>

159
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:04,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait here.</font>

160
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:08,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is there a problem?
- Just wait here.</font>

161
00:15:27,388 --> 00:15:28,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

162
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:33,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So,</font>

163
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:37,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you want to go overseas.
Kill some Nazis.</font>

164
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:40,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me?</font>

165
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:42,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Abraham Erskine.</font>

166
00:15:42,503 --> 00:15:45,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I represent
the Strategic Scientific Reserve.</font>

167
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steve Rogers.</font>

168
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:52,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you from?</font>

169
00:15:53,147 --> 00:15:57,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Queens. 73rd Street
and Utopia Parkway.</font>

170
00:15:57,752 --> 00:15:59,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before that, Germany.</font>

171
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:02,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This troubles you?
- No.</font>

172
00:16:03,624 --> 00:16:05,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you from, Mr. Rogers?</font>

173
00:16:06,094 --> 00:16:07,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it New Haven?</font>

174
00:16:08,896 --> 00:16:10,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or Paramus?</font>

175
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:13,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Five exams in five different cities.</font>

176
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:14,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That might not be the right file.</font>

177
00:16:14,802 --> 00:16:16,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's not the exams I'm interested in.</font>

178
00:16:16,738 --> 00:16:18,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the five tries.</font>

179
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:24,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you didn't answer my question.
Do you want to kill Nazis?</font>

180
00:16:27,048 --> 00:16:28,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this a test?</font>

181
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

182
00:16:33,855 --> 00:16:35,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to kill anyone.</font>

183
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:39,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like bullies.
I don't care where they're from.</font>

184
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:42,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there are already</font>

185
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:44,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so many big men fighting this war.</font>

186
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:46,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe what we need now is a little guy.</font>

187
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can offer you a chance.</font>

188
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:53,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only a chance.</font>

189
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:55,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll take it.
- Good.</font>

190
00:16:56,644 --> 00:17:00,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So where is
the little guy from? Actually?</font>

191
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:02,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooklyn.</font>

192
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:07,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations, soldier.</font>

193
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:33,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you ready, Dr. Zola?</font>

194
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:38,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My machine requires
the most delicate calibration.</font>

195
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:42,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive me if I seem overcautious.</font>

196
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you certain
that those conductors of yours</font>

197
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:49,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can withstand the energy surge
long enough for transference?</font>

198
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With this artifact</font>

199
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:52,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am certain of nothing.</font>

200
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:55,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fear it may not work at all.</font>

201
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:33,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Twenty percent.</font>

202
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forty.</font>

203
00:18:40,248 --> 00:18:41,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sixty.</font>

204
00:18:44,452 --> 00:18:46,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stabilizing at 70%.</font>

205
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:52,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have not come all this way
for safety, Doctor.</font>

206
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:12,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that?</font>

207
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:15,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must congratulate you, Arnim.</font>

208
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your designs do not disappoint.</font>

209
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Though they may require
some slight reinforcement.</font>

210
00:19:24,392 --> 00:19:26,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The exchange is stable.</font>

211
00:19:27,194 --> 00:19:28,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amazing!</font>

212
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The energy we have just collected</font>

213
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:34,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">could power my designs.
All my designs.</font>

214
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:39,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This will change the war.</font>

215
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:41,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Zola,</font>

216

219
00:19:53,454 --> 00:19:54,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen, I am Agent Carter.</font>

220
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:57,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I supervise all operations
for this division.</font>

221
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's with the accent, Queen Victoria?</font>

222
00:20:01,395 --> 00:20:03,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I was signing up
for the U.S. Army.</font>

223
00:20:03,564 --> 00:20:04,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your name, soldier?</font>

224
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gilmore Hodge, Your Majesty.</font>

225
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Step forward, Hodge.</font>

226
00:20:10,304 --> 00:20:11,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your right foot forward.</font>

227
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:14,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gonna wrassle?</font>

228

00:23:04,411 --> 00:23:05,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I let it slide. I thought, "What the hell."</font>

273
00:23:05,913 --> 00:23:07,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe he'd be useful to you,
like a gerbil.</font>

274
00:23:07,715 --> 00:23:08,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never thought you'd pick him.</font>

275
00:23:08,849 --> 00:23:10,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up.</font>

276
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stick a needle in that kid's arm,
it's gonna go right through him.</font>

277
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:17,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, girls.
- Look at that.</font>

278
00:23:18,392 --> 00:23:19,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's making me cry.</font>

279
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am looking for qualities
beyond the physical.</font>

280
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know how long it took
to set up this project?</font>

281
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:26,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the groveling I had to do</font>

282
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:27,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in front of Senator
What's-His-Name's committees?</font>

283
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:29,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brandt. Yes, I know.
I am well aware of your efforts.</font>

284
00:23:30,004 --> 00:23:33,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then throw me a bone.
Hodge passed every test we gave him.</font>

285
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's big, he's fast. He obeys orders.</font>

286
00:23:35,342 --> 00:23:36,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's a soldier.
- He is a bully.</font>

287
00:23:37,044 --> 00:23:39,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't win wars
with niceness, Doctor.</font>

288
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:45,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You win wars with guts.</font>

289
00:23:48,055 --> 00:23:49,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grenade!</font>

290
00:23:53,761 --> 00:23:55,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get away!</font>

291
00:23:55,596 --> 00:23:56,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back!</font>

292
00:24:04,271 --> 00:24:05,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a dummy grenade.</font>

293
00:24:06,907 --> 00:24:08,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All clear. Back in formation.</font>

294
00:24:13,214 --> 00:24:14,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this a test?</font>

295
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's still skinny.</font>

296
00:24:25,726 --> 00:24:27,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- May I?
- Yeah.</font>

297
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:32,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't sleep?</font>

298
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got the jitters, I guess.</font>

299
00:24:35,069 --> 00:24:36,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, too.</font>

300
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:39,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I ask you a question?</font>

301
00:24:39,807 --> 00:24:41,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just one?</font>

302
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why me?</font>

303
00:24:47,848 --> 00:24:50,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suppose that is
the only question that matters.</font>

304
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:56,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is from Augsburg. My city.</font>

305
00:24:59,526 --> 00:25:00,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So many people forget</font>

306
00:25:00,661 --> 00:25:03,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that the first country the Nazis invaded
was their own.</font>

307
00:25:03,864 --> 00:25:07,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, after the last war,
my people struggled.</font>

308
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:10,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They felt weak. They felt small.</font>

309
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:12,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then Hitler comes along
with the marching</font>

310
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:15,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the big show and the flags.</font>

311
00:25:16,543 --> 00:25:20,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he hears of me. My work.
And he finds me.</font>

312
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:21,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he says, "You."</font>

313
00:25:22,883 --> 00:25:24,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He says, "You will make us strong."</font>

314
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:28,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I am not interested.</font>

315
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So he sends the head of Hydra,</font>

316
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:34,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">his research division.</font>

317
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:37,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A brilliant scientist by the name
of Johann Schmidt.</font>

318
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:39,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, Schmidt is
a member of the inner circle.</font>

319
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he is ambitious.</font>

320
00:25:41,735 --> 00:25:47,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He and Hitler share a passion for
occult power and Teutonic myth.</i></font>

321
00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:50,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hitler uses his fantasies
to inspire his followers.</font>

322
00:25:50,878 --> 00:25:52,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy.</font>

323
00:25:53,147 --> 00:25:56,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For him, it is real.
He has become convinced</font>

324
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that there is a great power
hidden in the earth,</font>

325
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:00,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>left here by the gods,</i></font>

326
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">waiting to be seized by a superior man.</font>

327
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:08,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So when he hears about my formula
and what it can do, he cannot resist.</font>

328
00:26:11,665 --> 00:26:14,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Schmidt must become
that superior man.</i></font>

329
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did it make him stronger?</font>

330
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:22,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

331
00:26:22,943 --> 00:26:25,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But there were other effects.</font>

332
00:26:30,317 --> 00:26:31,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The serum was not ready.</font>

333
00:26:32,686 --> 00:26:35,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But more important, the man.</font>

334
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:38,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The serum amplifies
everything that is inside,</font>

335
00:26:38,993 --> 00:26:42,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so good becomes great.</font>

336
00:26:42,229 --> 00:26:43,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad becomes worse.</font>

337
00:26:49,236 --> 00:26:50,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is why you were chosen.</font>

338
00:26:51,972 --> 00:26:55,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because a strong man
who has known power all his life</font>

339
00:26:55,609 --> 00:26:57,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">may lose respect for that power,</font>

340
00:26:57,644 --> 00:27:00,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but a weak man knows
the value of strength.</font>

341
00:27:01,315 --> 00:27:03,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And knows</font>

342
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:05,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">compassion.</font>

343
00:27:08,222 --> 00:27:10,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks. I think.</font>

344
00:27:16,897 --> 00:27:19,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever happens tomorrow,
you must promise me one thing.</font>

345
00:27:23,003 --> 00:27:25,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That you will stay who you are.</font>

346
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:29,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a perfect soldier,</font>

347
00:27:29,977 --> 00:27:30,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but</font>

348
00:27:31,478 --> 00:27:33,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a good man.</font>

349
00:27:38,652 --> 00:27:40,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To the little guys.</font>

350
00:27:42,756 --> 00:27:44,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. Wait, wait. What I am doing?</font>

351
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:46,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you have procedure tomorrow.
No fluids.</font>

352
00:27:47,694 --> 00:27:49,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. We'll drink it after.</font>

353
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I don't have procedure tomorrow.
Drink it after? I drink it now.</font>

354
00:28:08,749 --> 00:28:11,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there something in particular
you need?</font>

355
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:20,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand you found him.</font>

356
00:28:21,095 --> 00:28:22,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See for yourself.</font>

357
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You disapprove.</font>

358
00:28:37,077 --> 00:28:40,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just don't see
why you need concern yourself.</font>

359
00:28:40,214 --> 00:28:41,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't imagine he will succeed.</font>

360
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:46,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Again.</font>

361
00:28:46,587 --> 00:28:50,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His serum is the Allies' only defense
against this power we now possess.</font>

362
00:28:50,691 --> 00:28:54,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we take it away from them,
then our victory is assured.</font>

363
00:28:57,498 --> 00:28:59,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall I give the order?</font>

364
00:29:00,234 --> 00:29:02,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It has been given.</font>

365
00:29:04,338 --> 00:29:05,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

366
00:29:08,308 --> 00:29:09,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Zola!</font>

367
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think?</font>

368
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:23,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A masterpiece.</font>

369
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:35,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know this neighborhood.</font>

370
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got beat up in that alley.</font>

371
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:41,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that parking lot.</font>

372
00:29:43,544 --> 00:29:45,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And behind that diner.</font>

373
00:29:45,946 --> 00:29:48,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you have something against
running away?</font>

374
00:29:51,084 --> 00:29:53,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You start running,
they'll never let you stop.</font>

375
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stand up, you push back.</font>

376
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:57,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They can't say no forever, right?</font>

377
00:29:57,891 --> 00:30:01,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know a little of what that's like,
to have every door shut in your face.</font>

378
00:30:02,729 --> 00:30:04,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I just don't know
why you'd want to join the Army</font>

379
00:30:04,731 --> 00:30:06,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you were a beautiful dame.</font>

380
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or a... A woman.</font>

381
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:09,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An agent. Not a dame.</font>

382
00:30:09,636 --> 00:30:11,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are beautiful, but...</font>

383
00:30:11,972 --> 00:30:14,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have no idea
how to talk to a woman, do you?</font>

384
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:16,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think this is the longest conversation
I've had with one.</font>

385
00:30:18,178 --> 00:30:21,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Women aren't exactly lining up
to dance with a guy they might step on.</font>

386
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:23,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must have danced.</font>

387
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:26,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, asking a woman to dance
always seemed so terrifying.</font>

388
00:30:27,254 --> 00:30:29,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the past few years, it just</font>

389
00:30:29,356 --> 00:30:32,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">didn't seem to matter that much.
I figured I'd wait.</font>

390
00:30:32,593 --> 00:30:33,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For what?</font>

391
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:36,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The right partner.</font>

392
00:30:51,378 --> 00:30:52,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way.</font>

393
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:58,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are we doing here?
- Follow me.</font>

394
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:14,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wonderful weather this morning,
isn't it?</font>

395
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:16,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.</font>

396
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:15,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning.</font>

397
00:32:17,197 --> 00:32:18,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, not now.</font>

398
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you ready?</font>

399
00:32:26,873 --> 00:32:30,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. Take off your shirt, your tie,
and your hat.</font>

400
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:37,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.</font>

401
00:32:37,884 --> 00:32:39,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?</font>

402
00:32:39,586 --> 00:32:41,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We needed access to
the city's power grid.</font>

403
00:32:41,555 --> 00:32:43,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, if you'd given me
the generators I requisitioned...</font>

404
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot of people are
asking for funds, Colonel.</font>

405
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:47,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is...</font>

406
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:49,222

- Yeah, yeah.</font>

478
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:30,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had him!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! Don't!</font>

489
00:41:41,094 --> 00:41:43,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go get him! I can swim!</font>

490
00:42:35,381 --> 00:42:37,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who the hell are you?
- The first of many.</font>

491
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut off one head,</font>

so much as a rifle in over a year.</font>

502
00:43:30,169 --> 00:43:32,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we had learned
through local intelligence</font>

503
00:43:32,672 --> 00:43:35,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you had mounted a full-scale incursion

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me show you.</font>

509
00:44:04,971 --> 00:44:07,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hitler speaks of a 1,000-year Reich,</font>

510
00:44:07,707 --> 00:44:09,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but he cannot feed his armies
for a month.</font>

511
00:44:09,709 --> 00:44:13,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His troops spill their blood
across every field in Europe,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">but still he is no closer to
achieving his goals.</font>

513
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:20,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I suppose you still aim
to win this war through magic?</font>

514
00:44:21,554 --> 00:44:25,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Science. But I understand
your confusion.</font>

515
00:44:25,825 --> 00:44:28,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great power has always
baffled primitive men.</font>

516

520
00:44:39,472 --> 00:44:42,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My weapons contain
enough destructive power</font>

521
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:44,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to decimate
every hostile capital on Earth.</font>

522
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:48,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quite simply, gentlemen,</font>

00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:52,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have harnessed the power of the gods.</font>

525
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:56,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For what?</font>

526
00:44:57,056 --> 00:45:00,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For making it clear
how obviously mad you are.</font>

527
00:45:00,393 --> 00:45:01,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Berlin is on this map!</font>

528
00:45:02,728 --> 00:45:04,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it is.</font>

529
00:45:06,365 --> 00:45:08,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will be punished for your insolence!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Schmidt...</font>

532
00:45:27,753 --> 00:45:29,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My apologies, Doctor,</font>

533
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:34,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we both knew Hydra could grow
no further in Hitler's shadow.</font>

534
00:45:36,129 --> 00:45:37,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hail Hydra.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think you got enough?</font>

538
00:46:00,786 --> 00:46:04,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any hope of reproducing the program
is locked in your genetic code.</font>

539
00:46:05,558 --> 00:46:08,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But without Dr. Erskine,
it would take years.</font>

540
00:46:09,529 --> 00:46:11,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He deserved more than this.</font>

541
00:46:12,632 --> 00:46:16,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it could work only once,
he'd be proud it was you.</font>

542
00:46:19,005 --> 00:46:21,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel Phillips,
my committee is demanding answers.</font>

543
00:46:22,308 --> 00:46:23,832

00:46:27,213 --> 00:46:28,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have we got here?</font>

546
00:46:28,814 --> 00:46:31,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speaking modestly, I'm the best
mechanical engineer in this country.</font>

547
00:46:32,185 --> 00:46:34,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I don't know what's inside this thing

- Hydra.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's led by Johann Schmidt.
But he has much bigger ambitions.</font>

554
00:46:49,168 --> 00:46:50,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hydra is practically a cult.</font>

555
00:46:50,469 --> 00:46:52,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They worship Schmidt.
They think he's invincible.</font>

556
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:53,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what are you going to do about it?</font>

557
00:46:54,807 --> 00:46:56,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I spoke to the President this morning.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir? If you're going after Schmidt,
I want in.</font>

00:47:09,121 --> 00:47:11,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're an experiment.
You're going to Alamogordo.</font>

578
00:47:53,866 --> 00:47:57,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, congratulations.

00:53:47,653 --> 00:53:48,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your plan today?</font>

675
00:53:49,088 --> 00:53:50,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need the casualty list from Azzano.</font>

676
00:53:50,356 --> 00:53:51,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't get to give me orders, son.</font>

677
00:53:51,757 --> 00:53:54,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just need one name,
Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.</font>

678
00:53:55,494 --> 00:53:57,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and I are gonna have a
conversation later that you won't enjoy.</font>

679
00:53:58,097 --> 00:54:01,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Please tell me if he's alive, sir. B-A-R...
- I can spell.</font>

680
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:11,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have signed more of these condolence
letters today than I would care to count.</font>

681
00:54:12,044 --> 00:54:14,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the name does sound familiar.</font>

682
00:54:14,713 --> 00:54:15,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

683
00:54:19,952 --> 00:54:22,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the others?
Are you planning a rescue mission?</font>

684
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:24,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, it's called "winning the war."</font>

685
00:54:25,557 --> 00:54:27,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if you know where they are,
why not at least...</font>

686
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:28,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're 30 miles behind the lines</font>

687
00:54:29,028 --> 00:54:31,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">through some of the most
heavily fortified territory in Europe.</font>

688
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:33,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'd lose more men than we'd save.</font>

689
00:54:33,465 --> 00:54:36,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I don't expect you to understand that
because you're a chorus girl.</font>

690
00:54:38,404 --> 00:54:39,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I understand just fine.</font>

691
00:54:40,339 --> 00:54:41,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then understand it
somewhere else.</font>

692
00:54:42,307 --> 00:54:46,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I read the posters correctly,
you got someplace to be in 30 minutes.</font>

693
00:54:51,383 --> 00:54:54,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir. I do.</font>

694
00:54:58,123 --> 00:55:03,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you have something to say, right now
is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.</font>

695
00:55:06,365 --> 00:55:08,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you plan to do, walk to Austria?</font>

696
00:55:08,367 --> 00:55:09,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If that's what it takes.</font>

697
00:55:09,835 --> 00:55:11,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You heard the Colonel.
Your friend is most likely dead.</font>

698
00:55:12,037 --> 00:55:13,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know that.</font>

699
00:55:13,105 --> 00:55:15,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even so, he's devising a strategy.
If he detects...</font>

700
00:55:15,174 --> 00:55:17,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the time he's done that,
it could be too late.</font>

701
00:55:18,077 --> 00:55:19,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steve!</font>

702
00:55:25,584 --> 00:55:29,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You told me you thought I was meant
for more than this. Did you mean that?</font>

703
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:32,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every word.</font>

704
00:55:34,426 --> 00:55:35,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you got to let me go.</font>

705
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:40,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can do more than that.</font>

706
00:55:41,233 --> 00:55:44,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On stage, girls. Five minutes!</font>

707
00:55:45,704 --> 00:55:46,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's my helmet?</font>

708
00:55:47,072 --> 00:55:48,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone seen Rogers?</font>

709
00:55:52,411 --> 00:55:54,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The Hydra camp is in Krausberg,</i></font>

710
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">tucked between
these two mountain ranges.</font>

711
00:55:56,582 --> 00:55:57,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a factory of some kind.</font>

712
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should be able to
drop you right on the doorstep.</font>

713
00:56:00,085 --> 00:56:01,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just get me as close as you can.</font>

714
00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:03,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two are gonna be
in a lot of trouble when you land.</font>

715
00:56:03,655 --> 00:56:04,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you won't?</font>

716
00:56:04,723 --> 00:56:07,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where I'm going, if anybody yells at me,
I can just shoot them.</font>

717
00:56:07,292 --> 00:56:08,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They will undoubtedly shoot back.</font>

718
00:56:09,027 --> 00:56:10,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, let's hope it's good for something.</font>

719
00:56:11,096 --> 00:56:12,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Agent Carter?</font>

720
00:56:12,231 --> 00:56:13,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we're not in too much of a hurry,</font>

721
00:56:13,632 --> 00:56:17,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought we could stop off in Lucerne
for a late-night fondue.</font>

722
00:56:22,441 --> 00:56:25,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stark is the best civilian pilot
I've ever seen.</font>

723
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:27,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's mad enough to brave this airspace.
We're lucky to have him.</font>

724
00:56:29,748 --> 00:56:31,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, are you two... Do you...</font>

725
00:56:33,952 --> 00:56:35,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...fondue?</font>

726
00:56:36,288 --> 00:56:38,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is your transponder.
Activate it when you're ready</font>

727
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:40,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the signal will lead us
straight to you.</font>

728
00:56:42,094 --> 00:56:43,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure this thing works?</font>

729
00:56:44,062 --> 00:56:46,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been tested more than you, pal.</font>

730
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:53,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back here!
We're taking you all the way in!</font>

731
00:56:55,808 --> 00:56:58,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As soon as I'm clear, you turn this thing
around and get the hell out of here!</font>

732
00:56:59,044 --> 00:57:01,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't give me orders!</font>

733
00:57:01,313 --> 00:57:03,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hell I can't! I'm a Captain!</font>

734
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:26,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>As you can see, production of
the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule,</i></font>

735
00:57:26,705 --> 00:57:29,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">even with components of this size.</font>

736
00:57:29,341 --> 00:57:32,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Increase the output by 60%</font>

737
00:57:32,344 --> 00:57:35,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and see to it our other facilities
do the same.</font>

738
00:57:36,515 --> 00:57:40,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But these prisoners,
I'm not sure they have the strength.</font>

739
00:57:41,186 --> 00:57:44,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then use up what strength
they have left, Doctor.</font>

740
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:47,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are always more workers.</font>

741
00:57:49,528 --> 00:57:50,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not now!</font>

742
00:58:06,044 --> 00:58:07,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, Fritz,</font>

743
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:11,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one of these days,
I'm gonna have a stick of my own.</font>

744
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:45,442

745
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:48,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you supposed to be?</font>

746
01:00:48,707 --> 01:00:51,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Captain America.</font>

747
01:00:53,245 --> 01:00:54,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I beg your pardon?</font>

748
01:00:58,116 --> 01:00:59,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, are we taking everybody?</font>

749
01:01:00,285 --> 01:01:01,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm from Fresno, Ace.</font>

750
01:01:02,054 --> 01:01:04,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there anybody else? I'm looking
for a Sergeant James Barnes.</font>

751
01:01:05,123 --> 01:01:08,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's an isolation ward in the factory,
but no one's ever come back from it.</font>

752
01:01:08,193 --> 01:01:09,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

753
01:01:09,394 --> 01:01:11,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The tree line is northwest,
80 yards past the gate.</font>

754
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:13,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out fast and give 'em hell.</font>

755
01:01:13,832 --> 01:01:15,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll meet you guys in the clearing
with anybody else I find.</font>

756
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:18,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. You know what you're doing?</font>

757
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:21,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I've knocked out Adolf Hitler
over 200 times.</font>

758
01:01:46,131 --> 01:01:47,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know how to use that thing?</font>

759
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:52,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

760
01:01:55,173 --> 01:01:56,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is happening?</font>

761
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:06,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Not exactly a Buick.</font>

762
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- That one. "Zündung."
- Zündung?</i></font>

763
01:02:11,289 --> 01:02:12,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get this thing going, Dugan!</font>

764
01:02:12,357 --> 01:02:13,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know you spoke German.</font>

765
01:02:13,792 --> 01:02:16,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three semesters at Howard,
switched to French, girls much cuter.</font>

766
01:02:17,095 --> 01:02:18,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't ask for the resume.</font>

767
01:02:30,842 --> 01:02:32,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- On your left!
- Up top!</font>

768
01:02:49,828 --> 01:02:52,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no! What are you doing?</font>

769
01:02:53,231 --> 01:02:56,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our forces are outmatched.</font>

770
01:03:20,859 --> 01:03:23,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep moving! Grab those grenades!</font>

771
01:04:03,168 --> 01:04:06,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sergeant. Three-two-five-five-seven.</font>

772
01:04:07,272 --> 01:04:08,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bucky?</font>

773
01:04:09,374 --> 01:04:10,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

774
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that...
- It's me.</font>

775
01:04:17,182 --> 01:04:19,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's Steve.
- Steve?</font>

776
01:04:19,117 --> 01:04:20,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on.
- Steve.</font>

777
01:04:24,723 --> 01:04:25,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you were dead.</font>

778
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:28,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you were smaller.</font>

779
01:04:36,067 --> 01:04:37,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

780
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:42,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What happened to you?
- I joined the Army.</font>

781
01:04:48,747 --> 01:04:50,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did it hurt?
- A little.</font>

782
01:04:51,249 --> 01:04:52,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this permanent?</font>

783
01:04:52,751 --> 01:04:53,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So far.</font>

784
01:05:23,848 --> 01:05:25,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain America!</font>

785
01:05:25,703 --> 01:05:27,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How exciting!</font>

786
01:05:27,872 --> 01:05:30,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am a great fan of your films!</font>

787
01:05:32,543 --> 01:05:36,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Dr. Erskine managed it after all.</font>

788
01:05:36,881 --> 01:05:38,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not exactly an improvement,</font>

789
01:05:38,783 --> 01:05:42,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but still, impressive.</font>

790
01:05:44,889 --> 01:05:46,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got no idea.</font>

791
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Haven't I?</font>

792
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:09,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No matter what lies Erskine told you,</font>

793
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you see, I was his greatest success!</font>

794
01:06:26,164 --> 01:06:27,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have one of those, do you?</font>

795
01:06:28,266 --> 01:06:30,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are deluded, Captain.</font>

796
01:06:31,269 --> 01:06:33,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You pretend to be a simple soldier,</font>

797
01:06:34,005 --> 01:06:36,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but in reality, you are just afraid</font>

798
01:06:36,507 --> 01:06:40,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to admit that
we have left humanity behind.</font>

799
01:06:41,946 --> 01:06:44,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unlike you, I embrace it proudly.</font>

800
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:46,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without fear!</font>

801
01:06:47,185 --> 01:06:48,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then how come you're running?</font>

802
01:07:00,598 --> 01:07:02,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, let's go. Up.</font>

803
01:07:05,603 --> 01:07:07,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir? Are we going to the roof?</font>

804
01:07:11,476 --> 01:07:12,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about me?</font>

805
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:14,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where will I sit?</font>

806
01:07:15,446 --> 01:07:17,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a scratch, Doctor.</font>

807
01:07:17,315 --> 01:07:18,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a scratch.</font>

808
01:07:51,849 --> 01:07:54,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go. One at a time.</font>

809
01:08:22,713 --> 01:08:25,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Gotta be a rope or something!
- Just go! Get out of here!</font>

810
01:08:25,783 --> 01:08:27,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! Not without you!</font>

811
01:08:28,085 --> 01:08:29,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell.</font>

812
01:08:50,575 --> 01:08:53,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Senator Brandt, I regret to report that</font>

813
01:08:54,011 --> 01:08:58,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing
behind enemy lines on the third.</font>

814
01:08:58,916 --> 01:09:01,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aerial reconnaissance
has proven unfruitful.</font>

815
01:09:01,152 --> 01:09:05,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a result,
I must declare Captain Rogers</font>

816
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:08,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">killed in action. Period.</font>

817
01:09:12,163 --> 01:09:13,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The last surveillance flight is back.</font>

818
01:09:16,334 --> 01:09:18,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No sign of activity.</font>

819
01:09:19,103 --> 01:09:21,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.</font>

820
01:09:24,509 --> 01:09:25,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't touch Stark.</font>

821
01:09:25,776 --> 01:09:28,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's rich and he's the Army's
number one weapons contractor.</font>

822
01:09:28,679 --> 01:09:30,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are neither one.</font>

823
01:09:30,281 --> 01:09:32,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With respect, sir,
I don't regret my actions.</font>

824
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:34,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I don't think
Captain Rogers did, either.</font>

825
01:09:34,619 --> 01:09:37,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What makes you think
I give a damn about your opinions?</font>

826
01:09:37,522 --> 01:09:39,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took a chance with you, Agent Carter.</font>

827
01:09:39,423 --> 01:09:42,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now America's golden boy
and a lot of other good men are dead</font>

828
01:09:43,094 --> 01:09:44,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause you had a crush.</font>

829
01:09:44,161 --> 01:09:46,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't that. I had faith.</font>

830
01:09:47,031 --> 01:09:51,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I hope that's a big comfort to you
when they shut this division down.</font>

831
01:09:54,138 --> 01:09:55,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell's going on out there?</font>

832
01:10:38,382 --> 01:10:40,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look who it is!</font>

833
01:11:07,311 --> 01:11:09,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some of these men
need medical attention.</font>

834
01:11:09,547 --> 01:11:11,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Medic, we got wounded.
- Right over here.</font>

835
01:11:11,549 --> 01:11:14,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to surrender myself
for disciplinary action.</font>

836
01:11:15,553 --> 01:11:17,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That won't be necessary.</font>

837
01:11:21,058 --> 01:11:22,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

838
01:11:23,861 --> 01:11:25,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Faith, huh?</font>

839
01:11:32,069 --> 01:11:33,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're late.</font>

840
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:38,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Couldn't call my ride.</font>

841
01:11:41,178 --> 01:11:42,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

842
01:11:42,913 --> 01:11:44,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's hear it for Captain America!</font>

843
01:12:01,565 --> 01:12:04,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I am honored
to present this medal for valor</i></font>

844
01:12:05,002 --> 01:12:08,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to my personal friend, Captain America!</font>

845
01:12:11,242 --> 01:12:12,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain America!</font>

846
01:12:14,478 --> 01:12:16,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain, that's your cue!</font>

847
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:22,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought he'd be taller.</font>

848
01:12:34,298 --> 01:12:37,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fifth one was here in Poland,
right near the Baltic.</font>

849
01:12:37,468 --> 01:12:39,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the sixth one was</font>

850
01:12:40,137 --> 01:12:45,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about here, 30, 40 miles west
of the Maginot Line.</font>

851
01:12:46,911 --> 01:12:48,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just got a quick look.</font>

852
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, nobody's perfect.</font>

853
01:12:54,752 --> 01:12:57,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are the weapon factories
we know about.</font>

854
01:12:57,588 --> 01:12:59,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sergeant Barnes said
that Hydra shipped</font>

855
01:12:59,523 --> 01:13:02,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all the parts to another facility
that isn't on this map.</font>

856
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:03,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Agent Carter, coordinate with Ml6.</font>

857
01:13:03,894 --> 01:13:06,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want every Allied eyeball
looking for that main Hydra base.</font>

858
01:13:06,664 --> 01:13:07,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about us?</font>

859
01:13:07,798 --> 01:13:10,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are going to set a fire
under Johann Schmidt's ass.</font>

860
01:13:10,668 --> 01:13:12,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you say, Rogers? It's your map.</font>

861
01:13:12,737 --> 01:13:16,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You think you can wipe Hydra off it?
- Yes, sir. I'll need a team.</font>

862
01:13:16,774 --> 01:13:18,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're already putting together
the best men.</font>

863
01:13:19,176 --> 01:13:21,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With all due respect, sir, so am I.</font>

864
01:13:23,347 --> 01:13:24,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, let's get this straight.</font>

865
01:13:24,815 --> 01:13:26,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We barely got out of there alive,
and you want us to go back?</font>

866
01:13:28,552 --> 01:13:29,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty much.</font>

867
01:13:29,887 --> 01:13:32,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds rather fun, actually.</font>

868
01:13:33,891 --> 01:13:34,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm in.</font>

869
01:13:47,538 --> 01:13:48,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're in.</font>

870
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell, I'll always fight.
But you got to do one thing for me.</font>

871
01:13:53,144 --> 01:13:54,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

872
01:13:56,313 --> 01:13:57,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open a tab.</font>

873
01:14:01,218 --> 01:14:02,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that was easy.</font>

874
01:14:03,053 --> 01:14:05,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Another round.
- Where are they putting all this stuff?</font>

875
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? I told you.</font>

876
01:14:12,329 --> 01:14:14,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're all idiots.</font>

877
01:14:14,899 --> 01:14:16,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about you?</font>

878
01:14:17,001 --> 01:14:20,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ready to follow Captain America
into the jaws of death?</font>

879
01:14:20,337 --> 01:14:21,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell, no.</font>

880
01:14:21,572 --> 01:14:26,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That little guy from Brooklyn who was
too dumb not to run away from a fight.</font>

881
01:14:27,244 --> 01:14:28,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm following him.</font>

882
01:14:32,416 --> 01:14:33,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're keeping the outfit, right?</font>

883
01:14:36,754 --> 01:14:37,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?</font>

884
01:14:39,056 --> 01:14:40,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's kind of growing on me.</font>

885
01:14:51,669 --> 01:14:53,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Captain.
- Agent Carter.</font>

886
01:14:55,806 --> 01:14:56,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ma'am.</font>

887
01:14:56,874 --> 01:14:59,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Howard has some equipment for you
to try. Tomorrow morning?</font>

888
01:14:59,944 --> 01:15:01,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds good.</font>

889
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:08,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see your top squad
is prepping for duty.</font>

890
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:10,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't like music?</font>

891
01:15:10,187 --> 01:15:11,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do, actually.</font>

892
01:15:13,357 --> 01:15:16,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I might even,
when this is all over, go dancing.</font>

893
01:15:17,194 --> 01:15:18,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then what are we waiting for?</font>

894
01:15:19,463 --> 01:15:20,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The right partner.</font>

895
01:15:22,132 --> 01:15:23,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">0800, Captain.</font>

896
01:15:24,635 --> 01:15:26,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am. I'll be there.</font>

897
01:15:27,304 --> 01:15:28,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm invisible.</font>

898
01:15:29,373 --> 01:15:32,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm turning into you.
It's like a horrible dream.</font>

899
01:15:33,043 --> 01:15:36,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't take it so hard.
Maybe she's got a friend.</font>

900
01:15:37,815 --> 01:15:40,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Emission signature is unusual.</font>

901
01:15:40,985 --> 01:15:42,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alpha and beta ray neutral.</font>

902
01:15:44,388 --> 01:15:46,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Though I doubt
Rogers picked up on that.</font>

903
01:15:48,492 --> 01:15:49,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seems harmless enough.</font>

904
01:15:51,161 --> 01:15:53,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hard to see what all the fuss is about.</font>

905
01:16:02,573 --> 01:16:03,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Write that down.</font>

906
01:16:05,843 --> 01:16:08,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Stark.</font>

907
01:16:08,646 --> 01:16:10,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's in with Colonel Phillips.</font>

908
01:16:15,519 --> 01:16:18,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, you're welcome to wait.</font>

909
01:16:25,729 --> 01:16:27,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I read about what you did.</font>

910
01:16:27,431 --> 01:16:29,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, the... Yeah.</font>

911
01:16:29,867 --> 01:16:31,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's, you know.</font>

912
01:16:33,037 --> 01:16:34,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just doing what needed to be done.</font>

913
01:16:34,772 --> 01:16:37,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounded like more than that.
You saved nearly 400 men.</font>

914
01:16:43,948 --> 01:16:45,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really, it's not a big deal.</font>

915
01:16:46,817 --> 01:16:48,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell that to their wives.</font>

916
01:16:52,323 --> 01:16:53,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think they were all married.</font>

917
01:16:54,124 --> 01:16:55,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a hero.</font>

918
01:16:55,793 --> 01:16:58,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that depends
on the definition, really.</font>

919
01:16:58,395 --> 01:17:01,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The women of America,
they owe you their thanks.</font>

920
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:05,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And seeing as they're not here...</font>

921
01:17:14,511 --> 01:17:15,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain!</font>

922
01:17:15,612 --> 01:17:18,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're ready for you,
if you're not otherwise occupied.</font>

923
01:17:19,383 --> 01:17:20,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Agent Carter, wait.</font>

924
01:17:21,151 --> 01:17:23,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like finding a partner
wasn't that hard after all.</font>

925
01:17:23,387 --> 01:17:24,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peggy, that's not
what you thought it was.</font>

926
01:17:25,089 --> 01:17:27,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think anything, Captain,
not one thing.</font>

927
01:17:27,992 --> 01:17:31,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You always wanted to be a soldier,
and now you are, just like all the rest.</font>

928
01:17:31,895 --> 01:17:32,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what about you and Stark?</font>

929
01:17:33,097 --> 01:17:35,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do I know you two
haven't been fondue-ing?</font>

930
01:17:40,504 --> 01:17:42,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still don't know
a bloody thing about women.</font>

931
01:17:44,408 --> 01:17:46,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Fondue is just cheese and bread,
my friend.</i></font>

932
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:49,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really? I didn't think...
- Nor should you, pal.</font>

933
01:17:49,413 --> 01:17:51,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The moment you think you know
what's going on in a woman's head</font>

934
01:17:51,515 --> 01:17:53,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is the moment your goose
is well and truly cooked.</font>

935
01:17:53,984 --> 01:17:56,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, I concentrate on work,
which at the moment</font>

936
01:17:56,754 --> 01:17:59,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is about making sure you and your men
do not get killed.</font>

937
01:17:59,857 --> 01:18:01,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carbon polymer.</font>

938
01:18:02,226 --> 01:18:04,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should withstand
your average German bayonet.</font>

939
01:18:04,695 --> 01:18:08,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Although Hydra's not going to
attack you with a pocket knife.</font>

940
01:18:08,532 --> 01:18:11,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hear you're kind of attached.</font>

941
01:18:11,368 --> 01:18:12,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's handier than you might think.</font>

942
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:14,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took the liberty
of coming up with some options.</font>

943
01:18:15,706 --> 01:18:16,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one's fun.</font>

944
01:18:17,574 --> 01:18:20,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's been fitted with electrical relays
that allow you to...</font>

945
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:21,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What about this one?
- No, no, that's just a prototype.</font>

946
01:18:21,879 --> 01:18:24,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's it made of?
- Vibranium.</font>

947
01:18:25,115 --> 01:18:27,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's stronger than steel
and a third the weight.</font>

948
01:18:28,385 --> 01:18:31,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's completely vibration absorbent.</font>

949
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:34,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How come it's not standard issue?</font>

950
01:18:34,858 --> 01:18:36,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the rarest metal on Earth.</font>

951
01:18:36,293 --> 01:18:37,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you're holding there,
that's all we've got.</font>

952
01:18:38,062 --> 01:18:40,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You quite finished, Mr. Stark?</font>

953
01:18:40,364 --> 01:18:42,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure the Captain
has some unfinished business.</font>

954
01:18:42,299 --> 01:18:44,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think?</font>

955
01:18:54,078 --> 01:18:56,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I think it works.</font>

956
01:19:05,355 --> 01:19:07,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had some ideas about the uniform.</font>

957
01:19:07,758 --> 01:19:09,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever you want, pal.</font>

958
01:21:13,951 --> 01:21:16,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are failing!</font>

959
01:21:17,187 --> 01:21:20,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are close to an offensive
that will shake the planet,</font>

960
01:21:20,557 --> 01:21:22,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">yet we are continually delayed</font>

961
01:21:22,593 --> 01:21:25,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because you cannot outwit
a simpleton with a shield!</font>

962
01:21:25,362 --> 01:21:27,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is hardly my area of expertise.</font>

963
01:21:27,431 --> 01:21:31,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I merely developed the weapons.
I cannot fire them.</font>

964
01:21:32,436 --> 01:21:35,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finish your mission, Doctor,
before the American finishes his.</font>

965
01:21:36,473 --> 01:21:37,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir!</font>

966
01:21:39,776 --> 01:21:40,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm sorry, Herr Schmidt.</i></font>

967
01:21:42,379 --> 01:21:44,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We fought to the last man.</font>

968
01:21:47,484 --> 01:21:49,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Evidently not.</font>

969
01:22:01,665 --> 01:22:04,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember when I made you ride
the Cyclone at Coney Island?</font>

970
01:22:04,968 --> 01:22:06,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, and I threw up?</font>

971
01:22:07,938 --> 01:22:09,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't payback, is it?</font>

972
01:22:09,506 --> 01:22:11,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now why would I do that?</font>

973
01:22:11,341 --> 01:22:14,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were right. Dr. Zola's on the train.</font>

974
01:22:14,177 --> 01:22:17,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hydra dispatcher gave him permission
to open up the throttle.</font>

975
01:22:17,814 --> 01:22:19,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wherever he's going,
they must need him bad.</font>

976
01:22:26,823 --> 01:22:29,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get going,
because they're moving like the devil.</font>

977
01:22:29,826 --> 01:22:31,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We only got about a 10-second window.</font>

978
01:22:31,628 --> 01:22:34,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You miss that window,
we're bugs on a windshield.</font>

979
01:22:34,831 --> 01:22:35,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind the gap.</font>

980
01:22:35,899 --> 01:22:37,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better get moving, bugs!</font>

981
01:23:45,602 --> 01:23:47,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop him! Fire again!</font>

982
01:24:40,323 --> 01:24:42,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I had him on the ropes.
- I know you did.</font>

983
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:44,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down!</font>

984
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:48,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire again!</font>

985
01:24:48,932 --> 01:24:50,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Kill him! Now!</i></font>

986
01:24:57,741 --> 01:24:58,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bucky!</font>

987
01:25:02,813 --> 01:25:04,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on!</font>

988
01:25:05,982 --> 01:25:06,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab my hand!</font>

989
01:26:12,549 --> 01:26:13,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit down.</font>

990
01:26:20,323 --> 01:26:22,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is this?
- Steak.</font>

991
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:24,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is in it?</font>

992
01:26:25,829 --> 01:26:27,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cow.</font>

993
01:26:30,233 --> 01:26:33,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor, do you realize how difficult it is</font>

994
01:26:33,336 --> 01:26:36,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to get ahold of a prime cut like that
out here?</font>

995
01:26:37,574 --> 01:26:38,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't eat meat.</font>

996
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:41,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

997
01:26:41,144 --> 01:26:42,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It disagrees with me.</font>

998
01:26:42,913 --> 01:26:45,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about cyanide? Does that give you
the rumbly tummy, too?</font>

999
01:26:48,752 --> 01:26:51,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every Hydra agent that
we've tried to take alive</font>

1000
01:26:52,022 --> 01:26:56,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has crunched a little pill before
we can stop him. But not you.</font>

1001
01:26:57,861 --> 01:27:00,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, here is my brilliant theory.</font>

1002
01:27:02,933 --> 01:27:04,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to live.</font>

1003
01:27:05,602 --> 01:27:07,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.</font>

1004
01:27:08,371 --> 01:27:09,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bought you dinner.</font>

1005
01:27:15,211 --> 01:27:18,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Given the valuable information
he has provided</font>

1006
01:27:19,049 --> 01:27:22,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and in exchange for
his full cooperation,</font>

1007
01:27:23,053 --> 01:27:25,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Dr. Zola is being remanded
to Switzerland"?</font>

1008
01:27:26,022 --> 01:27:29,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I sent that message to Washington
this morning, of course it was encoded.</font>

1009
01:27:30,694 --> 01:27:34,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys haven't broken those codes,
have you? That would be awkward.</font>

1010
01:27:34,397 --> 01:27:36,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Schmidt will know this is a lie.</font>

1011
01:27:36,466 --> 01:27:40,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.
You're a liability.</font>

1012
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:42,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know more about Schmidt
than anyone.</font>

1013
01:27:42,806 --> 01:27:47,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the last guy you cost us
was Captain Rogers' closest friend,</font>

1014
01:27:48,044 --> 01:27:50,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I wouldn't count on
the very best of protection.</font>

1015
01:27:51,748 --> 01:27:54,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's you or Schmidt.</font>

1016
01:27:54,985 --> 01:27:57,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just the hand you've been dealt.</font>

1017
01:27:59,656 --> 01:28:02,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Schmidt believes he walks
in the footsteps of the gods.</font>

1018
01:28:04,494 --> 01:28:07,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only the world itself will satisfy him.</font>

1019
01:28:07,397 --> 01:28:09,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do realize that's nuts, don't you?</font>

1020
01:28:09,699 --> 01:28:10,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1021
01:28:11,701 --> 01:28:13,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sanity of the plan
is of no consequence.</font>

1022
01:28:14,004 --> 01:28:16,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And why is that?
- Because he can do it!</font>

1023
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's his target?</font>

1024
01:28:19,442 --> 01:28:21,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His target</font>

1025
01:28:23,346 --> 01:28:24,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is everywhere.</font>

1026

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow,</font>

1027
01:28:47,637 --> 01:28:50,936

hundreds more will rain fire upon them!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, it's not like
we can just knock on the front door.</font>

1073
01:31:46,783 --> 01:31:48,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

1074
01:31:53,189 --> 01:31:55,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's exactly what we're going to do.</font>

1075
01:34:00,984 --> 01:34:05,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arrogance may not be
a uniquely American trait,</font>

1076
01:34:05,188 --> 01:34:07,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I must say,
you do it better than anyone.</font>

1077
01:34:10,226 --> 01:34:12,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But there are limits</font>

1078
01:34:13,229 --> 01:34:15,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to what even you can do, Captain.</font>

1079
01:34:15,999 --> 01:34:19,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?</font>

1080
01:34:19,335 --> 01:34:20,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He told me you were insane.</font>

1081
01:34:25,508 --> 01:34:27,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He resented my genius</font>

1082
01:34:27,577 --> 01:34:31,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and tried to deny me
what was rightfully mine.</font>

1083
01:34:31,247 --> 01:34:32,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he gave you everything.</font>

1084
01:34:35,251 --> 01:34:36,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So,</font>

1085
01:34:38,287 --> 01:34:40,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what made you so special?</font>

1086
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:45,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>

1087
01:34:46,396 --> 01:34:47,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.</font>

1088
01:34:59,475 --> 01:35:01,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can do this all day.</font>

1089
01:35:01,144 --> 01:35:03,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course you can, of course.</font>

1090
01:35:03,246 --> 01:35:06,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, unfortunately,
I am on a tight schedule.</font>

1091
01:35:12,255 --> 01:35:13,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So am I.</font>

1092
01:35:26,102 --> 01:35:28,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rogers! You might need this!</font>

1093
01:35:29,205 --> 01:35:30,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks!</font>

1094
01:35:41,417 --> 01:35:43,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're in! Assault team, go!</font>

1095
01:35:44,153 --> 01:35:45,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move out!</font>

1096
01:35:46,389 --> 01:35:48,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move!</font>

1097
01:35:54,030 --> 01:35:56,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep your spacing!</font>

1098
01:36:35,671 --> 01:36:37,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut off one head, two more shall...</font>

1099
01:36:39,375 --> 01:36:41,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go find two more!</font>

1100
01:37:07,770 --> 01:37:08,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're late.</font>

1101
01:37:11,774 --> 01:37:13,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Weren't you about to...
- Right.</font>

1102
01:38:28,417 --> 01:38:29,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get in!</font>

1103
01:38:58,114 --> 01:38:59,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Keep it steady!
- Wait!</font>

1104
01:39:04,987 --> 01:39:06,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go get him.</font>

1105
01:39:08,157 --> 01:39:09,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not kissing you!</font>

1106
01:42:49,311 --> 01:42:52,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You don't give up, do you?
- Nope!</font>

1107
01:44:01,317 --> 01:44:03,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could have the power of the gods!</font>

1108
01:44:04,587 --> 01:44:09,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yet you wear a flag on your chest
and think you fight a battle of nations!</font>

1109
01:44:10,125 --> 01:44:12,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have seen the future, Captain!</font>

1110
01:44:13,228 --> 01:44:16,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There are no flags!
- Not my future!</font>

1111
01:44:30,145 --> 01:44:31,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have you done?</font>

1112
01:44:32,147 --> 01:44:33,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1113
01:45:41,417 --> 01:45:43,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Come in. This is Captain Rogers.
Do you read me?</i></font>

1114

1115
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:46,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steve, is that you? Are you all right?</font>

1116
01:45:46,522 --> 01:45:48,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Peggy, Schmidt's dead!</i></font>

1117
01:45:48,724 --> 01:45:50,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What about the plane?</i></font>

1118
01:45:52,127 --> 01:45:53,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a little bit tougher to explain.</font>

1119
01:45:54,063 --> 01:45:56,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me your coordinates.
I'll find you a safe landing site.</font>

1120
01:45:57,733 --> 01:45:59,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's not gonna be a safe landing.</font>

1121
01:46:00,102 --> 01:46:01,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But I can try and force it down.</i></font>

1122
01:46:01,804 --> 01:46:03,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get Howard on the line.
He'll know what to do.</font>

1123
01:46:03,872 --> 01:46:04,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There's not enough time.</i></font>

1124
01:46:04,973 --> 01:46:07,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>This thing's moving too fast
and it's heading for New York.</i></font>

1125
01:46:12,181 --> 01:46:13,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got to put her in the water.</font>

1126
01:46:14,416 --> 01:46:17,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, don't do this.
We have time. We can work it out.</font>

1127
01:46:17,419 --> 01:46:18,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere.</font>

1128
01:46:18,654 --> 01:46:21,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I wait any longer,
a lot of people are gonna die.</font>

1129

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peggy,</font>

01:47:01,296 --> 01:47:04,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna need a rain check
on that dance.</font>

1134

<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1135
01:47:16,478 --> 01:47:18,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A week, next Saturday,
at the Stork Club.</font>

1136
01:47:20,315 --> 01:47:21,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got it.</font>

1137
01:47:23,552 --> 01:47:27,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>8:00 on the dot.

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
I still don't know how to dance.</font>

1139
01:47:38,167 --> 01:47:41,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll show you how. Just be there.</font>

1140
01:47:42,504 --> 01:47:44,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll have the band
play something slow.</font>

1141
01:47:48,243 --> 01:47:49,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'd hate to step on your...</i></font>

1148
01:49:28,277 --> 01:49:30,336

1149

<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the energy signature stops here.</font>

1150
01:49:34,783 --> 01:49:36,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just keep looking.</font>
