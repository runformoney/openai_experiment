1
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a girl in this harbor town</font>

2
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she works layin' whiskey down</font>

3
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They say, "Brandy, fetch another round"</font>

4
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she serves them whiskey and wine</font>

5
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sailors say "Brandy, you're a fine girl"</font>

6
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"What a good wife you would be"</font>

7
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on!
- Slow down!</font>

8
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way, my river lily! Come on!</font>

9
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you taking me?</font>

10
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on.</font>

11
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look. Look!</font>

12
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's beautiful!</font>

13
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was afraid it wouldn't take to the soil...</font>

14
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it rooted quickly.</font>

15
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And soon, it'll be everywhere.</font>

16
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All across the universe.</font>

17
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I don't know what
you're talking about...</font>

18
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I like the way you say it.</font>

19
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My heart is yours...</font>

20
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meredith Quill.</font>

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe I fell in love
with a spaceman.</font>

22
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Showtime, a-holes!</font>

23
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will be here any minute.</font>

24
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which will be its loss.</font>

25
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought your thing was a sword?</font>

26
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been hired to stop
an interdimensional beast...</font>

27
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?</font>

28
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just, swords were your thing
and guns were mine.</font>

29
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I guess we're both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.</font>

30
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?</font>

31
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It hurts.</font>

32
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It hurts?</font>

33
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have sensitive nipples.</font>

34
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!"</font>

35
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about him? What's he doing?</font>

36
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm finishing this so we can listen
to tunes while we work.</font>

37
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is that a priority?</font>

38
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blame Quill. He's the one
who loves music so much.</font>

39
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I actually agree with Drax on this.</font>

40
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's hardly important right now.</font>

41
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, okay. Sure, Quill.</font>

42
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, seriously, I side with Drax.</font>

43
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.</font>

44
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can clearly see you winking.</font>

45
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it. I'm using my left eye?</font>

46
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Groot.</font>

47
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were not looking at you funny.</font>

48
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's intense.</font>

49
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Groot!</font>

50
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Groot, get out of the way!
You're gonna get hurt!</font>

51
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

52
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! Spit it out!</font>

53
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

54
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Disgusting!</font>

55
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The beast's hide is too thick
to be pierced from the outside.</font>

56
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must cut through it from the inside.</font>

57
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

58
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no! Drax, wait a minute!</font>

59
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drax!</font>

60
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is he doing?</font>

61
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said the skin is too thick
to be pierced from the outside, so he...</font>

62
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That doesn't make any sense!
- I tried telling him that!</font>

63
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Skin is the same level of thickness
from the inside as from the outside!</font>

64
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I realize that.</font>

65
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is a cut on its neck.</font>

66
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rocket, get it to look up.</font>

67
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey! Up here!</font>

68
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch it, Quill!</font>

69
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! I have single-handedly
vanquished the beast!</font>

70
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

71
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are they called again?</font>

72
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anulax batteries.</font>

73
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harbulary batteries.</font>

74
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's nothing like what I just said.</font>

75
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they're worth
thousands of units apiece...</font>

76
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is why the Sovereign
hired us to protect them.</font>

77
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful what you say around these folks.
They're easily offended.</font>

78
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The cost of transgression is death.</font>

79
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We thank you, Guardians,
for putting your lives on the line.</font>

80
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.</font>

81
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every citizen is born
exactly as designed by the community.</font>

82
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Impeccable, both physically and mentally.</font>

83
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We control the DNA of our progeny...</font>

84
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">germinating them in birthing pods.</font>

85
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I prefer to make people
the old-fashioned way.</font>

86
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps someday,
you could give me a history lesson...</font>

87
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the archaic ways of our ancestors.</font>

88
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For academic purposes.</font>

89
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would be honored, yes.</font>

90
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the name of research...</font>

91
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think that could be pretty, uh...</font>

92
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">repulsive.</font>

93
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not into that kind of casual...</font>

94
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, please.</font>

95
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.</font>

96
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring it...</font>

97
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we shall gladly be on our way.</font>

98
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Family reunion. Yay.</font>

99
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand she is your sister.</font>

100
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's worth no more to me
than the bounty due for her on Xandar.</font>

101
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.</font>

102
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do with her as you please.</font>

103
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.</font>

104
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?</font>

105
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mother is from Earth.</font>

106
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your father?</font>

107
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.</font>

108
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see it within you.</font>

109
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An unorthodox genealogy.</font>

110
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A hybrid that seems particularly...</font>

111
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">reckless.</font>

112
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, they told me you people
were conceited douchebags...</font>

113
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that isn't true at all.</font>

114
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

115
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm using my wrong eye again, aren't I?</font>

116
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. That was meant to be
behind your back.</font>

117
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Count yourself blessed they didn't kill you.</font>

118
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're telling me.</font>

119
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna buy some batteries?</font>

120
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's get baldy to Xandar</font>

121
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and collect that bounty.</font>

122
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That stuff about my father...</font>

123
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who does she think she is?</font>

124
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you're sensitive about that.</font>

125
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.</font>

126
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry if it seemed like
I was flirting with the High Priestess.</font>

127
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wasn't.</font>

128
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care if you were.</font>

129
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I feel like you do care.</font>

130
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!</font>

131
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.</font>

132
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn shadow.</font>

133
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are two types of beings
in the universe...</font>

134
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">those who dance, and those who do not.</font>

135
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm-hmm.</font>

136
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I first met my beloved at a war rally.</font>

137
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God.</font>

138
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone in the village
flailed about, dancing.</font>

139
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except one woman.</font>

140
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My Ovette.</font>

141
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew immediately she was the one for me.</font>

142
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The most melodic song in the world
could be playing.</font>

143
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She wouldn't even tap her foot.</font>

144
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wouldn't move a muscle.</font>

145
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One might assume she was dead.</font>

146
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That does sound pretty hot.</font>

147
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would make my nether regions engorge.</font>

148
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I get it, yes.</font>

149
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.</font>

150
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.</font>

151
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

152
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm hungry. Hand me some of that yaro root.</font>

153
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. It's not ripe yet...</font>

154
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I hate you.</font>

155
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hate me?</font>

156
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You left me there
while you stole that stone for yourself.</font>

157
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yet here you stand, a hero.</font>

158
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will be free of these shackles
soon enough, and I will kill you.</font>

159
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear.</font>

160
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

161
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna live out the rest of your days</font>

162
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a prison on Xandar...</font>

163
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wishing you could.</font>

164
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is weird.</font>

165
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got a Sovereign fleet
approaching from the rear.</font>

166
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would they do that?</font>

167
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.</font>

168
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude!</font>

169
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

170
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't steal some of those.</font>

171
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.</font>

172
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What were you thinking?</font>

173
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, they were really easy to steal!</font>

174
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's your defense?
- Come on!</font>

175
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saw how that High Priestess
talked down to us.</font>

176
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I'm teaching her a lesson!</font>

177
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I didn't realize your motivation
was altruism.</font>

178
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...</font>

179
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and they're trying to kill us.
- Exactly!</font>

180
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was being sarcastic!</font>

181
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no!</font>

182
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're supposed to use a sarcastic voice!</font>

183
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I look foolish!</font>

184
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we put the bickering on hold until after
we survive this massive space battle?</font>

185
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- More incoming!
- Good!</font>

186
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna kill some guys!</font>

187
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not killing anyone.</font>

188
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All those ships are remotely piloted.</font>

189
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it!</font>

190
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is the delay, Admiral?</font>

191
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">High Priestess, the batteries,
they are exceptionally combustible...</font>

192
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and could destroy the entire fleet.</font>

193
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our concern is their slight
against our people.</font>

194
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We hired them and they steal from us.</font>

195
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is heresy of the highest order.</font>

196
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All command modules...</font>

198
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the nearest habitable planet?</font>

199
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called Berhert.</font>

200
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How many jumps?
- Only one.</font>

201
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the access point is 47 clicks away.</font>

202
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.</font>

203
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quill, to make it through that...</font>

204
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'd have to be the greatest
pilot in the universe.</font>

205
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucky for us, I...</font>

206
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am.</font>

207
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

208
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.</font>

209
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.</font>

210
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!</font>

211
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it.</font>

212
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Later on tonight, you're gonna be
laying down in your bed...</font>

213
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and there's gonna be something squishy
in your pillow case.</font>

214
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"</font>

215
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there!</font>

216
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You put your turd in my bed, I shave you.</font>

217
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it won't be my turd.</font>

218
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will be Drax's.</font>

219
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have famously huge turds.</font>

220
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're about to die,
and this is what we're discussing?</font>

221
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a...</font>

222

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude! Seriously!</font>

223
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Let me...</font>

224
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Idiots!</font>

225
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's what you get</font>

226
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when Quill flies.</font>

227
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow!</font>

228
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">20 clicks to the jump!</font>

231
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on.</font>

232
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not ripe.</font>

233
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Zylak. You can do this.</font>

234
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

235
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">15 clicks to the jump!</font>

236
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

237
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep going!</font>

238
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10 clicks!</font>

239
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Die, spaceship!</font>

240
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You suck, Zylak.</font>

241
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Typical.</font>

242

245
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone destroyed all our ships!</font>

246
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

247
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who?</font>

251
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a guy.</font>

252
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

253
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's still out there?</font>

254
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Groot, put your seatbelt on!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prepare for a really bad landing!</font>

256
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was awesome!</font>

257
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

258
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this!</font>

259
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is the other half of our ship?</font>

260
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My ship.</font>

gotten us through that field...</font>

262
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">had you flown with what's between your
ears instead of what's between your legs!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">If what's between my legs had a hand on it...</font>

264
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guarantee I could have landed
this ship with it.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter, we almost died
because of your arrogance.</font>

266
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More like because he stole...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Anulax batteries!</font>

00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just had a little man save us
by blowing up 50 ships!</font>

276
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How little?</font>

277
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I don't know, like this?</font>

278
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little 1-inch man saved us?</font>

279
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be much larger.</font>

280
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.</font>

281
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't call me a raccoon!</font>

282
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I took it too far.</font>

283
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I meant trash panda.</font>

284
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that better?</font>

285
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

286
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's worse. It's so much worse.</font>

287
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You son of a...</font>

288
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

289
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I've had it with you!
- No! Back up!</font>

290
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone followed you through the jump point.</font>

291
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Set me free, you'll need my help.</font>

292
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a fool, Nebula.</font>

293
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are a fool if you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.</font>

294
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll attack me the moment I let you go.</font>

295
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I won't.</font>

296
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.</font>

297
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet it's the 1-inch man.</font>

298
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After all these years, I've found you.</font>

299
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who the hell are you?</font>

300
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.</font>

301
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Ego...</font>

302
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm your dad, Peter.</font>

303
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what they say...</font>

304
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"You're out of luck until you've gone duck."</font>

305
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yondu!</font>

306
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on down!</font>

307
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After going around years in circles...</font>

308
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with this woman I end up marrying.</font>

309
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...</font>

310
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"but you're losing your mind!"</font>

311
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then again, she's always been that way.</font>

312
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could never trust her. You know?</font>

313
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stakar.</font>

314
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been some time.</font>

315
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It seems like this establishment
is the wrong kind of disreputable.</font>

316
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sir!
- Stakar!</font>

317
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a hundred Ravager factions.</font>

318
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lost the business of 99 of them
by serving one.</font>

319
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, sir. Please!</font>

320
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get away from me.</font>

321
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can go to hell then!</font>

322
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't give a damn what you think of me!</font>

323
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what are you following us for?</font>

324
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you're gonna listen to
what I gotta say!</font>

325
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't gotta listen to nothing!</font>

326
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You betrayed the code!</font>

327
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ravagers don't deal in kids.</font>

328
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!</font>

329
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't know because you didn't
want to know because it made you rich.</font>

330
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I demand a seat at the table!</font>

331
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wear these flames, same as you.</font>

332
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may dress like us...</font>

333
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.</font>

334
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the Colors of Ogord...</font>

335
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will never flash over your grave.</font>

336
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you think...</font>

337
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I take pleasure in exiling you...</font>

338
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're wrong.</font>

339
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You broke all our hearts.</font>

340
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, pathetic.</font>

341
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First, Quill betrays us...</font>

342
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.</font>

343
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We followed him because he was the one...</font>

344
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who wasn't afraid
to do what needed to be done.</font>

345
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seems he's goin' soft.</font>

346
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he's so soft, why are you whispering?</font>

347
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I'm right, Kraglin.</font>

348
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You best be very careful
what you say about our captain.</font>

349
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the hell is that?</font>

350
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yondu Udonta...</font>

351
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a proposition for you.</font>

352
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hired Yondu to pick you up...</font>

353
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when your mother passed away.</font>

354
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But instead of returning you...</font>

355
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yondu kept you.</font>

356
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no clue as to why.</font>

357
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'll tell you why.</font>

358
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I was a skinny little kid who could
squeeze into places adults couldn't.</font>

359
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It made it easier for thievin'.</font>

360
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I've been trying to
track you down ever since.</font>

361
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought Yondu was your father.</font>

362
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? We've been together this whole time...</font>

363
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?</font>

364
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look exactly alike.</font>

365
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One's blue!</font>

366
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he's not my father!</font>

367
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yondu was the guy who abducted me...</font>

368
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...</font>

369
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and kept me in terror
by threatening to eat me.</font>

370
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Eat you?
- Yeah.</font>

371
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that son of a bitch.</font>

372
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you locate us now?</font>

373
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, even where I reside,
out past the edge of what's known...</font>

374
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we've heard tell about the man
they call Star-Lord.</font>

375
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What say we head out there right now?</font>

376
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your associates are welcome.
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.</font>

377
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise you...</font>

378
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's unlike any other place you've ever seen.</font>

379
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there...</font>

380
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can explain your very special heritage.</font>

381
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finally get to be...</font>

382
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the father I've always wanted to be.</font>

383
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

384
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've gotta take a whiz.</font>

385
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not buying it.</font>

386
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go take a walk.</font>

387
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Mantis.</font>

388
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

389
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smiling.</font>

390
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.</font>

391
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not if you do it like that.</font>

392
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

393
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was raised alone on Ego's planet.</font>

394
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do not understand
the intricacies of social interaction.</font>

395
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I pet your puppy? It is adorable.</font>

396
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

397
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is called a practical joke!</font>

398
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I liked it very much!</font>

399
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just made it up!</font>

400
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me a break!</font>

401
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After all this time, you're gonna
show up, and all of a sudden...</font>

402
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- you wanna be my dad?
- I hear you.</font>

403
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And by the way, this could be a trap.</font>

404
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Kree purists, the Ravagers...</font>

405
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- they all want us dead.
- I know, but...</font>

406
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what?</font>

407
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that story you told me
about Zardu Hasselfrau?</font>

408
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who?</font>

409
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He owned a magic boat?</font>

410
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">David Hasselhoff?</font>

411
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

412
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a magic boat. A talking car.</font>

413
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did he talk again?</font>

414
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.</font>

415
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...</font>

416
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you would tell all the other children...</font>

417
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.</font>

418
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shooting Knight Rider
or touring with his band in Germany.</font>

419
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing that up now?</font>

420
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love that story.</font>

421
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate that story.</font>

422
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's so sad!</font>

423
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a kid, I used to see all the other kids
off playing catch with their dad.</font>

424
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I wanted that,
more than anything in the world!</font>

425
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my point, Peter.</font>

426
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if this man is your Hasselhoff?</font>

427
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he ends up being evil...</font>

428
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we will just kill him.</font>

429
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're leaving me with that fox?</font>

430
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not a fox.</font>

431
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoot her if she does anything suspicious.</font>

432
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Or if you feel like it.
- Okay.</font>

433
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be just a couple of days.</font>

434
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll be back before
Rocket's finished fixing the ship.</font>

435
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if the Sovereign come?</font>

436
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no way for them
to know we're here. Let's go.</font>

437
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm uncertain about parting ways.</font>

438
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, you're like an old woman.</font>

439
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I'm wise?</font>

440
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you have so much luggage?</font>

441
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want Groot playing with my things.</font>

442
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy.</font>

443
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is your goal here?
To get everybody to hate you?</font>

444
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because it's working.</font>

445
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again</font>

446
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain</font>

447
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you don't love me now</font>

448
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will never love me again</font>

449
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can still hear you saying</font>

450
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You would never break the chain</font>

451
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you don't love me now</font>

452
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will never love me again</font>

453
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can still hear you saying</font>

454
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You would never break the chain</font>

455
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, can I ask you a personal question?</font>

456
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

457
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one has ever asked me a personal question.</font>

458
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your antennae, what are they for?</font>

459
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their purpose?</font>

460
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Quill and I have a bet.</font>

461
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude. You're not supposed to say that!</font>

462
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I say...</font>

463
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...</font>

464
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your antennae will feel this,
and keep you from being decapitated.</font>

465
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. And if it's anything other than...</font>

466
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you specifically not being decapitated
by a doorway, I win.</font>

467
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are not for feeling doorways.</font>

468
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think...</font>

469
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.</font>

470
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are those?</font>

471
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.</font>

472
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You read minds?
- No.</font>

473
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Telepaths know thoughts.</font>

474
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Empaths feel feelings.</font>

475
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Emotions.</font>

476
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May I?</font>

477
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

478
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You feel love.</font>

479
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I guess I feel a general,
unselfish love for just about everybody.</font>

480
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

481
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Romantic, sexual love.</font>

482
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I don't.</font>

483
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- For her!
- No!</font>

484
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

485
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She just told everyone
your deepest, darkest secret!</font>

486
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, I think
you're overreacting a little bit!</font>

487
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must be so embarrassed!</font>

488
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do me! Do me!</font>

489
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have never felt such humor!</font>

490
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So unbelievably uncool.</font>

491
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Quill.</font>

492
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.</font>

493
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can also alter emotions to some extent.</font>

494
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, like what?</font>

495
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I touch someone who is sad...</font>

496
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can ease them into contentment
for a short while.</font>

497
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can make a stubborn person compliant.</font>

498
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I mostly use it to help my master sleep.</font>

499
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.</font>

500
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do one of those on me.</font>

501
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sleep.</font>

502
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love this song.</font>

503
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

504
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There!</font>

505
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah...</font>

506
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:41,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ain't so tough now without
all your toys, are you?</font>

507
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move!</font>

508
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crap.</font>

509
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey there, rat!</font>

510
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's it going, you blue idiot?</font>

511
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not so bad.</font>

512
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got ourselves a pretty good
little gig here.</font>

513
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This golden gal with
quite a high opinion of herself...</font>

514
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has offered us a large sum to deliver you
and your pals over to her...</font>

515
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because she wants</font>

516
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to kill y'all.</font>

517
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your friend...</font>

518
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's too many of them.</font>

519
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He needs my help. If you care about him...</font>

520
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you need to get me out of these bonds.</font>

521
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are going to kill him!</font>

522
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.</font>

523
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I put a tracer on your ship back there...</font>

524
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">during the war over Xandar.</font>

525
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me your word you won't hurt Groot...</font>

526
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'll tell you where the batteries are.</font>

527
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat.</font>

528
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.</font>

529
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise, you'd what?</font>

530
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll take them batteries.</font>

531
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're worth what?
A quarter mill on the open market?</font>

532
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That Priestess offered us a million.</font>

533
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A quarter is only one third of that!</font>

534
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A quarter ain't a third.</font>

535
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A quarter is 25.</font>

536
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

537
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't even buy a pair
of boots with 25 units.</font>

538
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enough!</font>

539
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The point is, we ain't stupid enough
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!</font>

540
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.</font>

541
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That ain't right!</font>

542
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.</font>

543
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No matter how many times Quill betrays you...</font>

544
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you protect him like
none of the rest of us much matter!</font>

545
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

546
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the one what sticks up for you!</font>

547
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it easy, Kraglin.</font>

548
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn straight, lad. He's gone soft.</font>

549
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suppose it's time for a change in leadership.</font>

550
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your damn guns down!</font>

551
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! Whoa!</font>

552
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There must be some kind of
peaceful resolution to this, fellas.</font>

553
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or even a violent one
where I'm standing over there.</font>

554
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, hello, boys.</font>

555
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not ripe.</font>

556
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome, everyone, to my world.</font>

557
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. You have your own planet?</font>

558
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. No larger than your Earth's Moon.</font>

559
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Humility.</font>

560
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like it.</font>

561
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, too, am extraordinarily humble.</font>

562
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You own a planet and can destroy
two dozen spaceships without a suit.</font>

563
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you exactly?</font>

564
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.</font>

565
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A Celestial, like a god?</font>

566
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm, small "g," son.</font>

567
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least on the days
I'm feeling humble as Drax.</font>

568
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

569
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know where I came from exactly.</font>

570
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First thing I remember is flickering...</font>

571
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">adrift in the cosmos utterly...</font>

572
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and entirely alone.</font>

573
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over millions of years...</font>

574
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I learned to control the molecules around me.</font>

575
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I grew smarter and stronger.</font>

576
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I continued building from there...</font>

577
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">layer by layer...</font>

578
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the very planet you walk on now.</font>

579
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

580
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I wanted more.</font>

581
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I desired...</font>

582
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">meaning.</font>

583
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"There must be some life
out there in the universe...</font>

584
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"besides just me," I thought.</font>

585
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And so, I set myself the task of finding it.</font>

586
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I created...</font>

587
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what I imagined biological life to be like...</font>

588
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">down to the most minute detail.</font>

589
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you make a penis?</font>

590
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude!</font>

591
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is wrong with you?</font>

592
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he is a planet, how could he
make a baby with your mother?</font>

593
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He would smush her!</font>

594
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't need to hear how my parents...</font>

595
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

596
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father would tell the story</font>

597
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of impregnating my mother
every winter solstice.</font>

598
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's disgusting.</font>

599
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was beautiful.</font>

600
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You Earthers have hang-ups.</font>

601
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Drax, I got a penis.</font>

602
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ha! Thank you!</font>

603
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not half bad.</font>

604
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh.
- Ugh.</font>

605
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...</font>

606
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and all the accompanying junk.</font>

607
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to experience
what it truly meant to be human...</font>

608
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as I set out amongst the stars...</font>

609
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until I found...</font>

610
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what I sought.</font>

611
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life.</font>

612
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was not alone in the universe after all.</font>

613
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When did you meet my mother?</font>

614
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not long after.</font>

615
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was with Meredith
that I first experienced love.</font>

616
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I called her my river lily.</font>

617
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And from that love, Peter...</font>

618
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you.</font>

619
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have searched for you for so long.</font>

620
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when I heard of a man from Earth...</font>

621
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...</font>

622
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew you must be the son
of the woman I loved.</font>

623
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you loved her, why did you leave her?</font>

624
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is mutiny!</font>

625
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is mutiny!</font>

626
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're scum!</font>

627
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

628
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain!</font>

629
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me! Please!</font>

630
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain!</font>

631
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the one what killed those men...</font>

632
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by leading them down the wrong path.</font>

633
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you're weak.</font>

634
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And stupid!</font>

635
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time for the Ravagers...</font>

636
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to rise once again to glory
with a new captain...</font>

637
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Taserface!</font>

638
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. Your name is...</font>

639
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Taserface?</font>

640
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

641
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you shoot tasers out of your face?</font>

642
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's metaphorical!</font>

643
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

644
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For what?</font>

645
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For it is a name what strikes fear...</font>

646
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">into the hearts of anyone what hears it.</font>

647
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

648
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay...</font>

649
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whatever you say.</font>

650
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shut up.</font>

651
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're next.</font>

652
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Udonta, I have waited a long time to do...</font>

653
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

654
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I am so sorry!</font>

655
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning, sir...</font>

656
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">looking in the mirror and then
in all seriousness saying to yourself...</font>

657
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"You know what would be
a really kick-ass name?</font>

658
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Taserface!"</font>

659
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how I hear you in my head!</font>

660
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was your second choice?</font>

661
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scrotum Hat?</font>

662
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">New plan. We're killing you first.</font>

663
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life...</font>

664
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.</font>

665
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's enough killing for today.</font>

666
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's the daughter of Thanos.</font>

667
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you were
the biggest sadist in the galaxy.</font>

668
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was when Daddy was paying my bills.</font>

669
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Priestess wants to kill the fox herself.</font>

670
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.</font>

671
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I assure you...</font>

672
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not as easy a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...</font>

673
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or a talking woodland beast.</font>

674
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want 10% of the take...</font>

675
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a couple more things.</font>

676
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got a whole box of hands...</font>

677
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- if that one don't work out.
- It is fine.</font>

678
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?</font>

679
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Kree consider themselves merciful.
It will be painless.</font>

680
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, here it is. It's the best ship we got.</font>

681
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Location of Ego's planet in the nav.</font>

682
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.</font>

683
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you gonna do with your share?</font>

684
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me</font>

685
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">battle one another in training.</font>

686
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every time my sister prevailed...</font>

687
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my father would replace a piece of me
with machinery...</font>

688
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">claiming he wanted me to be her equal.</font>

689
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But she won...</font>

690
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">again and again, and again,
never once refraining.</font>

691
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So after I murder my sister...</font>

692
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will buy a warship</font>

693
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with every conceivable instrument of death.</font>

694
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly...</font>

695
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">piece by piece...</font>

696
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...</font>

697
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know every single day.</font>

698
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

699
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was talking about, like, a pretty necklace.</font>

700
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or a nice hat.</font>

701
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something to make the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"</font>

702
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyways, happy trails.</font>

703
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.</font>

704
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She had brain cancer,
so everyone thought she was delusional.</font>

705
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter...</font>

706
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I'd love to believe all of this,
I really would.</font>

707
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you left...</font>

708
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the most wonderful woman ever...</font>

709
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to die alone.</font>

710
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.</font>

711
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I don't return regularly to my planet...</font>

712
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the light within it...</font>

713
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this form will wither and perish.</font>

714
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?</font>

715
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?</font>

716
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I loved your mother, Peter!</font>

717
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't stand to set foot on an Earth...</font>

718
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!</font>

719
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know exactly what that feels like!</font>

720
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to watch her die!</font>

721
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...</font>

722
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've made many mistakes, Peter.</font>

723
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're not one of them.</font>

724
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.</font>

725
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...</font>

726
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the light within.</font>

727
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are a part of you, Peter.</font>

728
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

729
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me your hands, son.</font>

730
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

731
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold them like that.</font>

732
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, close your eyes and concentrate.</font>

733
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take your brain to the center of this planet.</font>

734
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

735
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

736
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! It's okay.</font>

737
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just relax. Concentrate.</font>

738
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can do it. Bring it back.</font>

739
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

740
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, now shape it.</font>

741
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feel that energy.</font>

742
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

743
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're home.</font>

744
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter...</font>

745
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you get to this weird, dumb planet?</font>

746
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ego found me in my larva state.</font>

747
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Orphaned on my homeworld.</font>

748
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He raised me by hand, and kept me as his own.</font>

749
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're a pet?</font>

750
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suppose.</font>

751
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People usually want cute pets.</font>

752
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would Ego want such a hideous one?</font>

753
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am hideous?</font>

754
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are horrifying to look at. Yes.</font>

755
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that's a good thing.</font>

756
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh?</font>

757
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you're ugly, and someone loves you...</font>

758
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you know they love you for who you are.</font>

759
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beautiful people never know who to trust.</font>

760
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then I'm certainly grateful to be ugly.</font>

761
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those pools, they remind me of a time...</font>

762
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I took my daughter
to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.</font>

763
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was like you.</font>

764
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Disgusting?</font>

765
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Innocent.</font>

766
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drax?</font>

767
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's something I must tell you.</font>

768
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?</font>

769
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This gross bug lady is my new friend.</font>

770
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.</font>

771
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not ugly. Drax!</font>

772
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?</font>

773
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mantis...</font>

774
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can you show us where we'll be staying?</font>

775
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are there no other beings on this planet?</font>

776
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The planet is Ego.</font>

777
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A dog would not invite a flea
to live on his back.</font>

778
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're not a flea?</font>

779
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a flea with a purpose.</font>

780
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I help him sleep.</font>

781
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What were you about to say to Drax
before I walked out?</font>

782
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>

783
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your quarters are this way.</font>

784
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:53,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We deliver you to the Kree in the morning.</font>

785
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.</font>

786
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Taserface.</font>

787
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, tell the other guys we said...</font>

788
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Hi," Taserface!</font>

789
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?</font>

790
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Gef.</font>

791
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's too adorable to kill.</font>

792
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it to the tailor.</font>

793
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.</font>

794
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.</font>

795
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He offered me a place with the Ravagers.</font>

796
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.</font>

797
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I was young...</font>

798
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and greedy, and stupid.</font>

799
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like you stealing those batteries.</font>

800
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was mostly Drax.</font>

801
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me and Stakar and the other captains...</font>

802
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we weren't so different from
you and your friends.</font>

803
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only family I ever had.</font>

804
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I broke the code...</font>

805
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they exiled me.</font>

806
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what I deserve.</font>

807
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slow down, drama queen.</font>

808
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might deserve this, but I don't.</font>

809
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta get outta here.</font>

810
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Quill?</font>

811
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He went off with his old man.</font>

812
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ego?
- Yeah.</font>

813
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a day for dumbass names.</font>

814
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're smiling.
And for a second, I got a warm feeling.</font>

815
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then it was ruined
by those disgusting-ass teeth.</font>

816
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like a professional asshole or what?</font>

817
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty much a pro.</font>

818
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego
like you promised?</font>

819
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was skinny.</font>

820
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:50,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could fit into places we couldn't.
Good for thievin'.</font>

821
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-huh.</font>

822
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:58,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got an idea on how to get outta here.</font>

823
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we're gonna need your little friend.</font>

824
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mascot, mascot, mascot...</font>

825
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little fellow's all worked up!
He needs a drink!</font>

826
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look how cute it is when it's all riled up.</font>

827
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's goddang precious!</font>

828
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Psst!</font>

829
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, twig!</font>

830
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here.</font>

831
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

832
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, man...</font>

833
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what did they do to you?</font>

834
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?</font>

835
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's something I need you to get,
and bring back to me.</font>

836
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...</font>

837
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the thing I wore on my head.</font>

838
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:18,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.</font>

839
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got it?</font>

840
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my underwears.</font>

841
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.</font>

842
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to explain it more careful.</font>

843
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a prototype fin.</font>

844
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.</font>

845
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You explain it this time.</font>

846
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

847
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Vorker's eye.</font>

848
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He takes it out when he sleeps.</font>

849
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. Look again.</font>

850
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But leave the eye here.</font>

851
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:26,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

852
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gonna wake up tomorrow...</font>

853
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he's not gonna know...</font>

854
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where his eye is!</font>

855
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a desk.</font>

856
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We told you it was this big.</font>

857
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...</font>

858
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a bunch of severed human toes.</font>

859
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:58,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.</font>

860
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.</font>

861
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay?</font>

862
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No!</font>

863
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He thinks you want him to wear it as a hat.</font>

864
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not what I said!</font>

865
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Groot.</font>

866
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's relieved you don't want him to.</font>

867
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.</font>

868
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:24,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Groot.</font>

869
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On anyone, not just himself.</font>

870
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Groot.</font>

871
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...</font>

872
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the next minute it's just because
you realize part of that head is the hat.</font>

873
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why you don't like hats?</font>

874
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is an important conversation right now?</font>

875
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That ain't it.</font>

876
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't mean to do a mutiny.</font>

877
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They killed all my friends.</font>

878
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the third quadrant ready for release.</font>

879
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One more thing.</font>

880
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got any clones of Quill's
old music on the ship?</font>

881
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah.</font>

882
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got it!</font>

883
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yondu's got the fin!</font>

884
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

885
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Down there!</font>

886
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

887
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You maniac.</font>

888
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whole ship's gonna blow.</font>

889
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not the whole ship.</font>

890
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is this?</font>

891
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:04,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am sending you
the coordinates for Yondu's ship.</font>

892
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Release the quadrant!
- Aye, Captain!</font>

893
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I only ask one thing.</font>

894
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That your High Priestess...</font>

895
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:15,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">tell him the name of the man
what sealed his fate.</font>

896
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Taserface!</font>

897
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where to, Captain?</font>

898
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:44,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ego.</font>

899
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, boy!</font>

900
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:59,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It ain't healthy for a mammalian body
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.</font>

901
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that.</font>

902
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are about to do 700!</font>

903
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I guess this could all be mine someday.</font>

904
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rocket? Rocket, are you there?</font>

905
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing, Peter?</font>

906
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dance with me.</font>

907
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not going to dance with you.</font>

908
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Sam Cooke...</font>

909
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one of the greatest
Earth singers of all time.</font>

910
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drax thinks you're not a dancer.</font>

911
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you ever tell anyone about this...</font>

912
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will kill you.</font>

913
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:24,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When are we gonna do something
about this unspoken thing between us?</font>

914
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What unspoken thing?</font>

915
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This...</font>

916
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cheers, Sam and Diane...</font>

917
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a guy and a girl on a TV show
who dig each other...</font>

918
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but never say it because if they do,</font>

919
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the ratings would go down...</font>

920
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:38,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sort of thing.</font>

921
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no unspoken thing.</font>

922
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's a catch-22,
because if you said it,</font>

923
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then it would be spoken...</font>

924
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it...</font>

925
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you are telling the truth,
and admitting that there is.</font>

926
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's not what I...</font>

927
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:01,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What we should be discussing right now
is something about this place.</font>

928
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't feel right.</font>

929
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?</font>

930
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the one who wanted me to come here!</font>

931
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That girl Mantis...</font>

932
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she's afraid of something.</font>

933
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you trying to take this away from me?</font>

934
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:13,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not trying...</font>

935
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's my father. He's blood.</font>

936
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have blood on Earth
and you never wanted to return there.</font>

937
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Again, you made me come here!</font>

938
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:22,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.</font>

939
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's because that place is real,
and this is a fantasy.</font>

940
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is real! I'm only half human, remember?</font>

941
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the half I'm worried about.</font>

942
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I get it. You're jealous...</font>

943
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because I'm part-god,
and you like when I'm the weak one.</font>

944
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were insufferable to begin with.</font>

945
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't been able to reach Rocket.</font>

946
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna try and get a signal.</font>

947
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what? This is not Cheers after all!</font>

948
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is whatever the show is
where one person is willing...</font>

949
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to open themselves up to new possibility,</font>

950
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the other person is a jerk....</font>

951
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who doesn't trust anybody!</font>

952
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a show that doesn't exist.</font>

953
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why it would get zero ratings!</font>

954
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what Cheers is!</font>

955
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I finally found my family.
Don't you understand that?</font>

956
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you already had.</font>

957
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it.</font>

958
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Psychopath!</font>

959
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you kidding me?</font>

960
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:47,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I win.</font>

961
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I win. I bested you in combat.</font>

962
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I saved your life.</font>

963
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you were stupid enough to let me live.</font>

964
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:55,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You let me live!</font>

965
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't need you always trying to beat me!</font>

966
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not the one that just flew across the
universe just because I wanted to win.</font>

967
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not tell me what I want.</font>

968
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't need to tell you what you want!</font>

969
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's obvious!</font>

970
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were the one who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!</font>

971
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were all I had.</font>

972
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you were the one who needed to win.</font>

973
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos pulled my eye from my head...</font>

974
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and my brain from my skull...</font>

975
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and my arm from my body...</font>

976
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because of you.</font>

977
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all right, son?</font>

978
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw your girl stomp off
a little earlier in quite a huff.</font>

979
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

980
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fortuitous...</font>

981
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you listening to this song.</font>

982
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know...
- Brandy?</font>

983
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:11,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By Looking Glass?</font>

984
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A favorite of your mom's.</font>

985
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it was.</font>

986
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of Earth's greatest musical compositions.</font>

987
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps its very greatest.</font>

988
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:22,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

989
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter, you and I,
we're the sailor in that song.</font>

990
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He came on a summer's day</font>

991
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bringing gifts from far away</font>

992
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like the child I put in your mother...</font>

993
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or the freedom you brought Gamora.</font>

994
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brandy, you're a fine girl</font>

995
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a good wife you would be</font>

996
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:51,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My life, my love</font>

997
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My lady is the sea</font>

998
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sea calls the sailor back.</font>

999
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He loves the girl, but that's not his place.</font>

1000
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:04,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sea calls upon him
as history calls upon great men.</font>

1001
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.</font>

1002
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you may not be mortal, but me...</font>

1003
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Peter...</font>

1004
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">death will remain a stranger to both of us...</font>

1005
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as long as the light burns within the planet.</font>

1006
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm immortal?</font>

1007
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:21,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm-hmm.</font>

1008
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

1009
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:26,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! As long as the light exists.</font>

1010
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:30,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I can use the light
to build cool things...</font>

1011
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like how you made this whole planet?</font>

1012
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It might take you
a few million years of practice...</font>

1013
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before you get really good at it. But, yes!</font>

1014
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:38,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What!</font>

1015
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:42,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get ready for an 800-foot statue
of Pac-Man with Skeletor...</font>

1016
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:43,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Heather Locklear.</font>

1017
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can do anything you want.</font>

1018
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna make some weird shit.</font>

1019
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:50,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous responsibility.</font>

1020
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only we can remake the universe.</font>

1021
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:55,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only we can take the bridle of the cosmos...</font>

1022
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:58,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and lead it to where it needs to go.</font>

1023
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How?</font>

1024
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come with me.</font>

1025
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drax, Drax. Drax!</font>

1026
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drax! We need to talk.</font>

1027
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1028
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:32,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I like a woman
with some meat on her bones.</font>

1029
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1030
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:36,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried to let you down easily
by telling you I found you disgusting.</font>

1031
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's not what I...</font>

1032
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

1033
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:46,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm imagining being with you physically.</font>

1034
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drax...</font>

1035
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:49,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like you like that.</font>

1036
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't even like the type of thing you are.</font>

1037
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! There's no need to get personal.</font>

1038
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen! Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.</font>

1039
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should have told you earlier.</font>

1040
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm stupid. You are in danger.</font>

1041
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

1042
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.</font>

1043
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything around us, including the girl...</font>

1044
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:23,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything is temporary.</font>

1045
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are forever.</font>

1046
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:27,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't eternity get boring?</font>

1047
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not if you have a purpose, Peter...</font>

1048
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is why you're here.</font>

1049
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you how all those years ago...</font>

1050
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:39,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had an unceasing impulse to find life.</font>

1051
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:43,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what I did not tell you was how,
when I finally did find it...</font>

1052
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it was all so...</font>

1053
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">disappointing.</font>

1054
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:53,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that is when I came...</font>

1055
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:57,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to a profound realization.</font>

1056
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My innate desire to seek out other life...</font>

1057
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:07,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was not so that I could walk among that life.</font>

1058
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter...</font>

1059
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:15,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have found meaning.</font>

1060
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see it.</font>

1061
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eternity!</font>

1062
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1063
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to get off this planet.</font>

1064
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man.</font>

1065
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, before I was so rudely interrupted...</font>

1066
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At that time, I was a Federal Express man.</font>

1067
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:29,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell you doing, boy?</font>

1068
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could tell by how you talked about him...</font>

1069
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this Ego is bad news.</font>

1070
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're here to save Quill.</font>

1071
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:38,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For what? Huh? For honor? For love?</font>

1072
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I don't care about those things.</font>

1073
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna save Quill
so I can prove I'm better than him!</font>

1074
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:47,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can lord this over him forever.</font>

1075
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you laughing at me for?</font>

1076
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:56,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can fool yourself and everyone else,
but you can't fool me.</font>

1077
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know who you are.</font>

1078
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know anything about me, loser.</font>

1079
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know everything about you.</font>

1080
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you play like
you're the meanest and the hardest...</font>

1081
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but, actually, you're the most scared of all.</font>

1082
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:07,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up!</font>

1083
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:10,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you steal batteries you don't need...</font>

1084
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:13,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...</font>

1085
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because just a little bit of love...</font>

1086
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:17,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.</font>

1087
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said shut up!</font>

1088
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:23,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know them scientists what made you,
never gave a rat's ass about you.</font>

1089
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm serious, dude!</font>

1090
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like my own damn parents who sold me...</font>

1091
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">their own little baby, into slavery.</font>

1092
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know who you are, boy.</font>

1093
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you're me.</font>

1094
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of a pair are we?</font>

1095
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The kind that's about to
go fight a planet, I reckon.</font>

1096
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, okay! Good. Wait.</font>

1097
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fight a what?</font>

1098
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:57,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you people?</font>

1099
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this place?</font>

1100
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:00,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gamora, let her go!</font>

1101
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bodies in the caverns... Who are they?</font>

1102
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are scared.</font>

1103
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:11,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I call it the Expansion.</font>

1104
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:15,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is my purpose...</font>

1105
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:19,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now it is yours as well.</font>

1106
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's beautiful.</font>

1107
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over thousands of years...</font>

1108
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I implanted thousands
of extensions of myself...</font>

1109
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on thousands of worlds.</font>

1110
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to fulfill life's one true purpose...</font>

1111
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To grow and spread...</font>

1112
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:40,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">covering all that exists...</font>

1113
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:45,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until everything is...</font>

1114
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me!</font>

1115
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did she do to me?</font>

1116
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She already told me everything.</font>

1117
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I only had one problem.</font>

1118
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:58,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A single Celestial doesn't have enough power</font>

1119
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for such an enterprise.</font>

1120
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But two Celestials...</font>

1121
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:06,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, now, that just might do.</font>

1122
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bodies...</font>

1123
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are his children.</font>

1124
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out of all my labors...</font>

1125
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the most beguiling was...</font>

1126
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.</font>

1127
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hoped the result of such a coupling
would be enough...</font>

1128
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to power the Expansion.</font>

1129
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had Yondu deliver some of them to me.</font>

1130
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:33,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It broke the Ravager code,
but I compensated him generously...</font>

1131
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:37,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.</font>

1132
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:40,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.</font>

1133
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But one after the other, they failed me.</font>

1134
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:47,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not one of them carried the Celestial genes.</font>

1135
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until you, Peter.</font>

1136
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out of all my spawn...</font>

1137
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:57,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">only you carried the connection to the light.</font>

1138
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:00,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.</font>

1139
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ego will have won him to his side by now.</font>

1140
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Then we just go.
- No!</font>

1141
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's our friend.
- All any of you do...</font>

1142
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is yell at each other. You are not friends.</font>

1143
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:11,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right.</font>

1144
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're family.</font>

1145
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We leave no one behind.</font>

1146
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:21,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except maybe you.</font>

1147
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1148
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the first time in my existence...</font>

1149
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:29,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am truly not alone!</font>

1150
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it, son?</font>

1151
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friends.</font>

1152
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:46,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, that's the mortal in you, Peter.</font>

1153
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1154
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:50,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are beyond such things.</font>

1155
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:52,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1156
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now...
- But my mother...</font>

1157
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said you loved my mother.</font>

1158
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that I did.</font>

1159
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My river lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.</font>

1160
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I returned to Earth to see her three times.</font>

1161
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I knew if I returned a fourth...</font>

1162
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd never leave.</font>

1163
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Expansion...</font>

1164
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:24,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the reason for my very existence,
would be over.</font>

1165
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I did what I had to do.</font>

1166
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.</font>

1167
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:37,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1168
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, all right...</font>

1169
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that sounds bad.</font>

1170
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who in the hell do you think you are?</font>

1171
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You killed my mother!</font>

1172
01:29:58,760 --> 01:29:59,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried...</font>

1173
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:01,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so hard...</font>

1174
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to find the form...</font>

1175
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that best suited you...</font>

1176
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and this is the thanks I get?</font>

1177
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really need to grow up.</font>

1178
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:19,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to do this together...</font>

1179
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I suppose you'll have to learn</font>

1180
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by spending the next thousand years
as a battery!</font>

1181
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finally! Rocket?</font>

1182
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:31,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep that transmitter nearby,
so I can find you.</font>

1183
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:34,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're in an old piece of construction
equipment Yondu once used...</font>

1184
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:35,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to slice open the Bank of A'askavaria.</font>

1185
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:36,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ego's unhinged.</font>

1186
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know Get ready,</font>

1187
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:39,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop her, Kraglin.</font>

1188
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1189
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My life, my love</font>

1190
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My lady is the sea</font>

1191
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter...</font>

1192
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:22,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this is the sea.</font>

1193
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

1194
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, there, jackass!</font>

1195
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that thing?</font>

1196
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!</font>

1197
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:35,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you something didn't feel right.</font>

1198
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I told you so."
Just what I need to hear right now.</font>

1199
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I came back, didn't I?</font>

1200
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because there's an unspoken thing.</font>

1201
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no unspoken thing.</font>

1202
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?
You could've killed us all!</font>

1203
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... "Thank you, Rocket"?</font>

1204
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had it under control.</font>

1205
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We did not. That is only an extension...</font>

1206
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of his true self. He will be back soon.</font>

1207
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:55,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's Smurfette doing here?</font>

1208
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:58,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever I need to do to get
a damn ride home.</font>

1209
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She tried to murder me!</font>

1210
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saved you, you stupid fox!</font>

1211
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not a fox.</font>

1212
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I am Groot.
- I'm not a raboon, either.</font>

1213
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Groot.</font>

1214
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Raccoon." Whatever.</font>

1215
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:12,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do we kill a Celestial?</font>

1216
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a center to him.</font>

1217
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His brain, his soul, whatever it is...</font>

1218
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some sort of protective shell.</font>

1219
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:19,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's in the caverns...</font>

1220
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:20,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">below the surface.</font>

1221

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yondu?</font>

1222
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thrusters are out.</font>

1223
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid.</font>

1224
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise, you'd have
delivered me to this maniac.</font>

1225
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still reckon that's the reason
I kept you around, you idiot?</font>

1226
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what you told me, you old doofus.</font>

1227
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:46,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once I figured out
what happened to them other kids...</font>

1228
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wasn't just gonna hand you over.</font>

1229
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:49,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said you were gonna eat me.</font>

1230
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was being funny!</font>

1231
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not to me!</font>

1232
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You people have issues.</font>

1233
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:56,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course I have issues.</font>

1234
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my freakin' father!</font>

1235
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thrusters are back up.</font>

1236
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We should be going up!
- We can't!</font>

1237
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ego wants to eradicate
the universe as we know it.</font>

1238
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to kill him.</font>

1239
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:22,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rocket!</font>

1240
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:23,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it!</font>

1241
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:32,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo-hoo!</font>

1242
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we're saving the galaxy again?</font>

1243
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:40,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess.</font>

1244
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:42,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Awesome!</font>

1245
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're really gonna be able to
jack up our prices...</font>

1246
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if we're two-time galaxy savers.</font>

1247
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.</font>

1248
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:53,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was just a random thought, man.
I thought we were friends.</font>

1249
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, I care about the planets,
and the buildings...</font>

1250
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and all the animals on the planets.</font>

1251
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the people.</font>

1252
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meh.</font>

1253
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:05,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The crabby puppy is so cute.
He makes me wanna die!</font>

1254
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pilots...</font>

1255
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">release envoy units.</font>

1256
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:52,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our sensors detect the batteries
are below the surface of the planet.</font>

1257
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dive!</font>

1258
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:13,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um... Captain?</font>

1259
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:15,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain?</font>

1260
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:22,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me why Ego wants you here?</font>

1261
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He needs my genetic connection
to the light...</font>

1262
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to help destroy the universe.</font>

1263
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He tried to teach me
how to control the power.</font>

1264
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:30,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, could you?</font>

1265
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:31,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little.</font>

1266
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I made a ball.</font>

1267
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A ball?</font>

1268
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:36,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought as hard as I could.</font>

1269
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:37,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was all that I could come up with.</font>

1270
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You "thought"?</font>

1271
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:41,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think when I make this arrow fly...</font>

1272
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:43,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I use my head?</font>

1273
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

1274
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There.</font>

1275
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Ego's core.</font>

1276
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That ore is thick, Rocket.</font>

1277
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it covered.</font>

1278
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:21,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must hurry.</font>

1279
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will not take Ego long to find us.</font>

1280
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:29,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep it steady.</font>

1281
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:38,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We drill into the center, we kill him!</font>

1282
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:45,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain?</font>

1283
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it, Kraglin?</font>

1284
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?</font>

1285
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:51,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, why?
- Uh...</font>

1286
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hell!</font>

1287
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:15,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why aren't you firing the lasers?</font>

1288
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They blew out the generator.</font>

1289
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:20,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I packed a small detonator.</font>

1290
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:22,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A detonator is worthless without explosives.</font>

1291
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:23,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we got these.</font>

1292
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?</font>

1293
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction...</font>

1294
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">throughout his entire nervous system.</font>

1295
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:31,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meaning what?</font>

1296
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The entire planet will explode.</font>

1297
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll have to get out of here fast.</font>

1298
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:36,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I rigged a timer.</font>

1299
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:38,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

1300
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's coming.</font>

1301
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't you say you could make him sleep?</font>

1302
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:00,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When he wants. He's too powerful.</font>

1303
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:02,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't!</font>

1304
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to believe in yourself...</font>

1305
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because I believe in you.</font>

1306
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:20,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sleep!</font>

1307
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never thought she'd be able to do it...</font>

1308
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with as weak and skinny as she appears to be.</font>

1309
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:36,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know how long I can hold him.</font>

1310
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:41,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The metal's too thick.</font>

1311
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:44,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the bomb to work, we'd actually
need to place it on Ego's core.</font>

1312
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:46,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And our fat butts ain't gonna fit
through those tiny holes.</font>

1313
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:48,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

1314
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:53,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a terrible idea.</font>

1315
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is the only kind of idea we have left.</font>

1316
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:58,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unbelievable.</font>

1317
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."</font>

1318
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:03,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a day.</font>

1319
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:14,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, first you flick this switch,
then this switch.</font>

1320
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:16,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That activates it.</font>

1321
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:18,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you push this button...</font>

1322
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:21,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which will give you 5 minutes
to get out of there.</font>

1323
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:22,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, whatever you do...</font>

1324
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">don't push this button...</font>

1325
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:28,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because that will set off
the bomb immediately</font>

1326
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:29,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we'll all be dead.</font>

1327
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:32,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, repeat back what I just said.</font>

1328
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.</font>

1329
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:36,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I am Groot.
- That's right.</font>

1330
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I am Groot.
- No!</font>

1331
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:40,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!</font>

1332
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:41,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try again.</font>

1333
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:43,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm...</font>

1334
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I am Groot.
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

1335
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.</font>

1336
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:49,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Groot.</font>

1337
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! That's exactly what you just said!</font>

1338
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is that even possible?</font>

1339
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:55,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?</font>

1340
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:57,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Point to it.</font>

1341
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:58,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1342
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you're making him nervous!</font>

1343
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:02,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up and get me some tape!</font>

1344
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:03,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does anybody have any tape out there?</font>

1345
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:05,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna put some tape over the death button.</font>

1346
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:08,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have any tape. Let me check.</font>

1347
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:11,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, Yondu... Ow!</font>

1348
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have any tape?</font>

1349
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:19,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gamora? Do you have any tape?</font>

1350
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tape!</font>

1351
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:22,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never mind. Ow!</font>

1352
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:26,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drax, do you have any tape?</font>

1353
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:29,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Scotch tape would work.</font>

1354
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,</font>

1355
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you don't have any?</font>

1356
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody has any tape!</font>

1357
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:36,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a single person has tape?</font>

1358
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:38,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope!</font>

1359
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:39,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you ask Nebula?</font>

1360
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:41,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

1361
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:42,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure?</font>

1362
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I asked Yondu...</font>

1363
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and she was sitting next to him.
- I knew you were lying!</font>

1364
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have priceless batteries
and an atomic bomb in your bag.</font>

1365
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:51,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!</font>

1366
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:54,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!</font>

1367
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are wasting a lot of time here!</font>

1368
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whee!</font>

1369
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:05,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're all gonna die.</font>

1370
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rear thrusters are out again!</font>

1371
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:12,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're done for without that generator!</font>

1372
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guardians...</font>

1373
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:29,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">perhaps it will provide you solace...</font>

1374
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:32,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that your deaths are not without purpose.</font>

1375
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They will serve as a warning...</font>

1376
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:37,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to all of those tempted with betraying us.</font>

1377
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't screw with the Sovereign.</font>

1378
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is gonna hurt.</font>

1379
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:46,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Promises, promises.</font>

1380
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1381
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:10,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1382
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No! No!</font>

1383
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:20,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna blow!</font>

1384
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:27,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter! No!</font>

1385
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1386
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like Mary Poppins.</font>

1387
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:52,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he cool?</font>

1388
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:55,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell, yeah, he's cool.</font>

1389
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!</font>

1390
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:27,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mantis, look out!</font>

1391
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:41,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's just unconscious.</font>

1392
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:58,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long until the bomb goes off?</font>

1393
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:01,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the unlikely event
that Groot doesn't kill us all...</font>

1394
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:02,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about 6 minutes.</font>

1395
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:10,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kraglin, we need the quadrant
for an extraction.</font>

1396
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:11,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">T-minus 5 minutes.</font>

1397
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:12,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aye, Captain.</font>

1398
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:18,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody's gotta be up top
when Kraglin arrives.</font>

1399
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drax, take Mantis.</font>

1400
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:25,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow! My nipples!</font>

1401
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gamora!</font>

1402
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:39,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter!</font>

1403
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:07,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get over it.</font>

1404
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:11,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come now, Peter.
I know this isn't what you want.</font>

1405
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:18,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of father would I be
to let you make this choice?</font>

1406
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

1407
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:53,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.</font>

1408
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So stop pissing me off!</font>

1409
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:18,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to get up to the extraction point!</font>

1410
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:28,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

1411
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you...</font>

1412
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:33,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to do this alone.</font>

1413
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:37,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You cannot deny...</font>

1414
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:41,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the purpose the universe
has bestowed upon you.</font>

1415
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:52,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone, I need you to stay back!</font>

1416
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:53,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

1417
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:11,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't need to be like this, Peter.</font>

1418
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:17,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you destroying our chance?</font>

1419
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop pretending you aren't what you are.</font>

1420
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:25,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One in billions.</font>

1421
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trillions. Even more.</font>

1422
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:36,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What greater meaning
can life possibly have to offer?</font>

1423
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:42,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy!</font>

1424
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:45,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I use my heart...</font>

1425
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:24,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shouldn't have killed my mom,
and squished my Walkman.</font>

1426
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:28,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you don't love me now</font>

1427
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:30,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will never love me again</font>

1428
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:33,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can still hear you saying</font>

1429
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:37,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You would never break the chain</font>

1430
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:39,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you don't love me now</font>

1431
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:42,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will never love me again</font>

1432
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:47,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can still hear you saying</font>

1433
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:50,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You would never break the chain</font>

1434
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:53,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you don't love me now</font>

1435
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:56,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will never love me again</font>

1436
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:59,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can still hear you saying</font>

1437
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:01,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You would never break the chain</font>

1438
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:07,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Groot? If you can hear me, hurry up!</font>

1439
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:10,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure how long Quill
can keep him distracted!</font>

1440
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:12,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Groot, hurry!</font>

1441
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:10,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yondu, we're about to blow!</font>

1442
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get to the ship!</font>

1443
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:13,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not without Quill!</font>

1444
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to take care of the twig!</font>

1445
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:18,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not without you!</font>

1446
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:23,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't done nothin' right
my whole damn life, rat.</font>

1447
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:29,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to give me this.</font>

1448
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:38,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

1449
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:41,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A spacesuit and an aero-rig.</font>

1450
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I only have one of each.</font>

1451
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:57,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Groot.</font>

1452
01:53:58,760 --> 01:53:59,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

1453
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:05,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He says, "Welcome to the frickin'
Guardians of the Galaxy."</font>

1454
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:08,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only he didn't use "frickin'."</font>

1455
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:16,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye, twig.</font>

1456
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:21,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna need to have
a real discussion about your language.</font>

1457
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Peter?</font>

1458
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rocket, where is he?</font>

1459
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:21,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rocket.</font>

1460
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:23,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rocket, look at me! Where is he?</font>

1461
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:27,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm...</font>

1462
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:32,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I'm not leaving without him.</font>

1463
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:40,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1464
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can only afford to lose one friend today.</font>

1465
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:45,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kraglin, go!</font>

1466
01:55:46,240 --> 01:55:47,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait...</font>

1467
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is Quill back?</font>

1468
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:53,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rocket, where's Quill?</font>

1469
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:57,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rocket, where's Quill?</font>

1470
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:00,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rocket!</font>

1471
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:02,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Quill?</font>

1472
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:06,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Quill?</font>

1473
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we need to stop it.</font>

1474
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:23,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

1475
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:25,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop. Listen to me!</font>

1476
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are a god.</font>

1477
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:30,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you kill me...</font>

1478
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:32,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'll be just like everybody else.</font>

1479
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:35,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's so wrong with that?</font>

1480
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:36,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1481
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:29,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He may have been your father, boy,</font>

1482
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:30,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but he wasn't your daddy.</font>

1483
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.</font>

1484
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:41,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm damn lucky you're my boy.</font>

1485
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:47,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1486
01:57:57,920 --> 01:57:59,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yondu, what are you doing?</font>

1487
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:00,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't.</font>

1488
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:02,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yondu!</font>

1489
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:10,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1490
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:15,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1491
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:18,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Aww...</font>

1492
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:21,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No!</font>

1493
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:24,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no!</font>

1494
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told Gamora...</font>

1495
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how when I was a kid I used to pretend</font>

1496
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:24,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">David Hasselhoff was my dad.</font>

1497
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:29,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a singer and actor from Earth,
really famous guy.</font>

1498
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:33,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Earlier, it struck me...</font>

1499
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:38,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yondu didn't have a talking car,
but he did have a flying arrow.</font>

1500
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:41,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't have
the beautiful voice of an angel...</font>

1501
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:43,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but he did have the whistle of one.</font>

1502
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:47,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...</font>

1503
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:50,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and hooked up with hot women...</font>

1504
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:52,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and fought robots.</font>

1505
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:59,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of
end up being my dad after all.</font>

1506
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:00,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only it was you, Yondu.</font>

1507
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:08,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a pretty cool dad.</font>

1508
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:14,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I'm trying to say here is...</font>

1509
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:20,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sometimes that thing
you're searching for your whole life...</font>

1510
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:24,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's right there by your side all along.</font>

1511
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:26,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't even know it.</font>

1512
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:40,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Groot.</font>

1513
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:43,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He did call you twig.</font>

1514
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:47,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nebula...</font>

1515
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:54,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was a child like you.</font>

1516
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:59,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.</font>

1517
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:02,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.</font>

1518
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:04,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying to make it right.</font>

1519
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:05,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are little girls like you...</font>

1520
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">across the universe who are in danger.</font>

1521
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:13,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can stay with us and help them.</font>

1522
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:15,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will help them by killing Thanos.</font>

1523
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:18,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know if that's possible.</font>

1524
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:35,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will always be my sister.</font>

1525
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:20,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pete!</font>

1526
02:02:24,240 --> 02:02:26,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain found this for you in a junker shop.</font>

1527
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:29,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Said you'd come back to the fold someday.</font>

1528
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:31,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

1529
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:33,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called a Zune.</font>

1530
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:34,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's what everybody's listening to
on Earth nowadays.</font>

1531
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:36,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's got 300 songs on it.</font>

1532
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:39,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">300 songs?</font>

1533
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:45,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

1534
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:53,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rocket grabbed the pieces,
and reassembled them.</font>

1535
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:55,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think Yondu would want you to have it.</font>

1536
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:00,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks...</font>

1537
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:03,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain.</font>

1538
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:45,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not time to make a change</font>

1539
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:50,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just relax, take it easy</font>

1540
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:54,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're still young, that's your fault</font>

1541
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:57,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's so much you have to know</font>

1542
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:01,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find a girl, settle down</font>

1543
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:04,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want you can marry</font>

1544
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:10,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy</font>

1545
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:17,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They came.</font>

1546
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:26,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

1547
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:29,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager buddies,</font>

1548
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and told them what he did.</font>

1549
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a Ravager funeral.</font>

1550
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:55,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

1551
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:57,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

1552
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:06,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't let us down after all, Captain.</font>

1553
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:09,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he did not, son.</font>

1554
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:11,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He did not.</font>

1555
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:21,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fare thee well, old friend.</font>

1556
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:28,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yondu Udonta, I will see you in the stars.</font>

1557
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't chase them away.</font>

1558
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:36,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1559
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even though he yelled at them.</font>

1560
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:41,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And was always mean.</font>

1561
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:45,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he stole batteries he didn't need.</font>

1562
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:52,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, of course not.</font>

1563
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:18,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1564
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just...</font>

1565
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:25,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">some unspoken thing.</font>

1566
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:36,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's beautiful.</font>

1567
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:39,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is.</font>

1568
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:43,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And so are you.</font>

1569
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the inside.</font>

1570
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:54,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now there's a way</font>

1571
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:59,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I know that I have to go away</font>

1572
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:03,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know I have to go</font>

1573
02:08:42,360 --> 02:08:43,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, it's a shame...</font>

1574
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:47,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu
to bring us all together again.</font>

1575
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:51,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I think he'd be proud knowing
that we are back as a team.</font>

1576
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm in.</font>

1577
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:54,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dope.</font>

1578
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:56,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I miss you guys so much!</font>

1579
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:57,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell, yes.</font>

1580
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:02,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What say we steal some shit?</font>

1581
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:23,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">High Priestess, the Council is waiting.</font>

1582
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:28,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are perturbed I've wasted our resources.</font>

1583
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:35,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When they see what I have created here...</font>

1584
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:37,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">their wrath will dissipate.</font>

1585
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:42,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a new type of birthing pod, ma'am?</font>

1586
02:11:43,600 --> 02:11:44,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That, my child...</font>

1587
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is the next step in our evolution.</font>

1588
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:50,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More powerful, more beautiful...</font>

1589
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:54,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">more capable of destroying
the Guardians of the Galaxy.</font>

1590
02:11:57,040 --> 02:11:59,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I shall call him...</font>

1591
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:02,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Adam.</font>

1592
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:06,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh, dude.</font>

1593
02:14:07,120 --> 02:14:08,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously?</font>

1594
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:10,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta clean up your room.
It's a complete mess.</font>

1595
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:12,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Groot.</font>

1596
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:14,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not boring. You're boring.</font>

1597
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:15,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what's boring?</font>

1598
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:18,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sitting there,
playing that mind-numbing game.</font>

1599
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:22,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's boring is me tripping over
your vines every day!</font>

1600
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:24,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not boring!</font>

1601
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:25,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Groot.</font>

1602
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:29,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now I know how Yondu felt.</font>

1603
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:07,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In these times of hardship...</font>

1604
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just remember...</font>

1605
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:15,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We. Are. Groot.</font>

1606
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:20,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, fellas.</font>

1607
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:21,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, where are you going?</font>

1608
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were supposed to be my lift home.</font>

1609
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:26,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How will I get out of here?</font>

1610
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:27,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Aw, gee...</font>

1611
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:30,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got so many more stories to tell.</font>

1612
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:31,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, guys.</font>

1613
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:34,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, gee...</font>
