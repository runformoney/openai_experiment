1
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.</font>

2
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is crazy. What did I do?</font>

3
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like you're going to pull over
and snuff me.</font>

4
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forrest!</font>

5
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can talk, sir.</font>

6
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:39,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
- No, you intimidate them.</font>

7
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:43,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good God, you're a woman.
I honestly... I couldn't have called that.</font>

8
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I'd apologize,
but isn't that what we're going for here?</font>

9
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.</font>

10
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.</font>

11
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm kind of having a hard time
not looking at you now.</font>

12
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that weird? Come on, it's okay, laugh.</font>

13
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.</font>

14
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it true you went 12 for 12
with last year's Maxim cover models?</font>

15
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.</font>

16
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">March and I had a scheduling conflict,</font>

17
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but fortunately,
the Christmas cover was twins.</font>

18
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything else? You're kidding me
with the hand up, right?</font>

19
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
- Yes. It's very cool.</font>

20
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

21
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.</font>

22
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, no gang signs.</font>

23
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, throw it up. I'm kidding.</font>

24
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.</font>

25
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:34,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Hurry up. Just click it.
Don't change any settings. Just click it.</font>

26
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's going on?
- Contact left!</font>

27
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have we got?</font>

28
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jimmy, stay with Stark!</font>

29
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stay down!
- Yeah.</font>

30
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch!</font>

31
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
- Stay here!</font>

32
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

33
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony Stark.</font>

34
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Visionary. Genius.</font>

35
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">American patriot.</font>

36
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even from an early age,</font>

37
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the son of legendary
weapons developer Howard Stark</font>

38
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.</font>

39
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At age 4,
he built his first circuit board.</font>

40
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At age 6, his first engine.</font>

41
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from MIT.</font>

42
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, the passing of a titan.</font>

43
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:54,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Howard Stark's lifelong friend
and ally, Obadiah Stane,</font>

44
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,</font>

45
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns</font>

46
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:04,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.</font>

47
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With the keys to the kingdom,</font>

48
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,</font>

49
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics, satellite targeting.</font>

50
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry</font>

51
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by ensuring freedom
and protecting America</font>

52
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and her interests around the globe.</font>

53
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As liaison to Stark Industries,</font>

54
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.</font>

55
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is my friend
and he is my great mentor.</font>

56
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor</font>

57
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:48,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to present this year's Apogee Award
to Mr. Tony Stark.</font>

58
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony?</font>

59
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thanks for the save.</font>

60
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.</font>

61
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is wonderful.</font>

62
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm not Tony Stark.</font>

63
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:28,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if I were Tony,
I would tell you how honored I feel</font>

64
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:33,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and what a joy it is
to receive this very prestigious award.</font>

65
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, you know...</font>

66
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.</font>

67
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's always working.</font>

68
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Work it! Come on!</font>

69
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We should just stay till the morning.
- You are unbelievable.</font>

70
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
- Nobody roped me into anything!</font>

71
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that</font>

72
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.</font>

73
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you, that's great.</font>

74
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So when do we do it?
- It's right here.</font>

75
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.</font>

76
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.</font>

77
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.</font>

78
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have any of those
floating around.</font>

79
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna let it ride!</font>

80
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.</font>

81
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you, too.</font>

82
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.</font>

83
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...</font>

84
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two craps. Line away.</font>

85
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.</font>

86
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?</font>

87
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is where I exit.
- All right.</font>

88
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow, don't be late.</font>

89
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!</font>

90
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, I know.</font>

91
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's. There you go.</font>

92
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark!</font>

93
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.</font>

94
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I ask you a couple of questions?</font>

95
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She's cute.
- She's all right?</font>

96
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi.
- Hi.</font>

97
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. Okay, go.
- It's okay?</font>

98
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.</font>

99
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do you say to that?
- Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.</font>

100
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what do you say
to your other nickname?</font>

101
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The Merchant of Death"?</font>

102
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not bad.</font>

103
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let me guess. Berkeley?
- Brown, actually.</font>

104
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Ms. Brown,</font>

105
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.</font>

106
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,</font>

107
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll start making bricks and beams
for baby hospitals.</font>

108
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rehearse that much?</font>

109
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every night in front of the mirror
before bedtime.</font>

110
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you first-hand.</font>

111
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I want is a serious answer.</font>

112
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,</font>

113
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Peace means having a bigger stick
than the other guy."</font>

114
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a great line
coming from the guy selling the sticks.</font>

115
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father helped defeat the Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.</font>

116
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot of people,
including your professors at Brown,</font>

117
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would call that being a hero.</font>

118
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And a lot of people
would also call that war profiteering.</font>

119
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved</font>

120
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by advancing medical technology</font>

121
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?</font>

122
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.</font>

123
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ever lose an hour of sleep
your whole life?</font>

124
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.</font>

125
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.</font>

126
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The weather in Malibu
is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.</font>

127
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The surf conditions are fair
with waist-to-shoulder high lines.</font>

128
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.</font>

129
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony?</font>

130
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Tony?</font>

131
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are not authorized
to access this area.</font>

132
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jesus.
- That's Jarvis. He runs the house.</font>

133
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,</font>

134
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and there's a car waiting for you outside</font>

135
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.</font>

136
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
- Indeed I am.</font>

137
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:25,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After all these years, Tony still has you
picking up the dry-cleaning.</font>

138
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,</font>

139
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.</font>

140
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will that be all?</font>

141
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me an exploded view.</font>

142
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The compression in cylinder 3
appears to be low.</font>

143
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Log that.</font>

144
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm gonna try again, right now.
- Please don't turn down my music.</font>

145
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:02,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll keep you posted.</font>

146
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are supposed to be
halfway around the world right now.</font>

147
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How'd she take it?
- Like a champ.</font>

148
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you trying to hustle me
out of here?</font>

149
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your flight was scheduled to leave
an hour and a half ago.</font>

150
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's funny, I thought with it being
my plane and all,</font>

151
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that it would just wait for me
to get there.</font>

152
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, I need to speak to you
about a couple things</font>

153
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before I get you out of the door.</font>

154
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane</font>

155
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if it departs before you arrive?</font>

156
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.</font>

157
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want it? Yes or no.</font>

158
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it a good representation
of his spring period?</font>

159
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. The Springs was actually
the neighborhood in East Hampton</font>

160
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where he lived and worked,</font>

161
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- not "spring" like the season.
- So?</font>

162
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:39,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's a fair example.
I think it's incredibly overpriced.</font>

163
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need it. Buy it. Store it.</font>

164
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.
The MIT commencement speech...</font>

165
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is in June. Please, don't harangue me
about stuff that's way, way, down...</font>

166
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.</font>

167
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.</font>

168
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.</font>

169
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you trying to get rid of me for?
What, you got plans?</font>

170
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.</font>

171
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.</font>

172
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's your birthday?
- Yes.</font>

173
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew that. Already?</font>

174
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.</font>

175
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get yourself something nice from me.
- I already did.</font>

176
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And?
- It was very nice.</font>

177
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:17,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.</font>

178
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome, Miss Potts.</font>

179
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

180
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're good.
I thought I lost you back there.</font>

181
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:51,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did, sir.
I had to cut across Mulholland.</font>

182
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you. I got you.</font>

183
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong with you?</font>

184
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- 3 hours.</font>

185
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got caught doing a piece
for Vanity Fair.</font>

186
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For 3 hours. For 3 hours
you got me standing here.</font>

187
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.</font>

188
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wheels up! Rock and roll!</font>

189
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What you reading, platypus?
- Nothing.</font>

190
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.</font>

191
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?</font>

192
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.</font>

193
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't need to apologize to me.
I'm your man.</font>

194
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...</font>

195
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm just indifferent right now.
- Hot towel?</font>

196
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't respect yourself,</font>

197
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.</font>

198
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just your babysitter.</font>

199
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, when you need
your diaper changed... Thank you.</font>

200
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me know
and I'll get you a bottle, okay?</font>

201
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?</font>

202
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thanks for reminding me.
- No, I'm not talking...</font>

203
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not drinking.
We're working right now.</font>

204
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You can't have sashimi without sake.
- You are constitutionally</font>

205
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">incapable of being responsible.</font>

206
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would be irresponsible not to drink.
I'm just talking about a nightcap.</font>

207
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hot sake?</font>

208
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, two, please.
- No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.</font>

209
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I'm talking about.</font>

210
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,</font>

211
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you know what I recognize?</font>

212
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:03,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!</font>

213
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...</font>

214
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. You don't have to be like me!
But you're more than what you are.</font>

215
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?</font>

216
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!</font>

217
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">General.</font>

218
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward
to your weapons presentation.</font>

219
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

220
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it better to be feared or respected?</font>

221
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I say, is it too much to ask for both?</font>

222
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With that in mind,
I humbly present the crown jewel</font>

223
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.</font>

224
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the first missile system</font>

225
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.</font>

226
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:58,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.</font>

227
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I respectfully disagree.</font>

228
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:05,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.</font>

229
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.</font>

230
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's worked out pretty well so far.</font>

231
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find an excuse</font>

232
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:16,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you</font>

233
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.</font>

234
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:42,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For your consideration, the Jericho.</font>

235
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be throwing one of these in</font>

236
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with every purchase
of 500 million or more.</font>

237
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:57,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To peace!</font>

238
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?</font>

239
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How'd it go?</font>

240
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It went great. Looks like it's gonna be
an early Christmas.</font>

241
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:10,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?</font>

242
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why aren't you wearing those pajamas
I got you?</font>

243
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good night, Tony.</font>

244
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, Tony.
- I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."</font>

245
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.</font>

246
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nice job.
- See you back at base.</font>

247
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't do that if I were you.</font>

248
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell did you do to me?</font>

249
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I did?</font>

250
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I did is to save your life.</font>

251
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,</font>

252
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's headed into your atrial septum.</font>

253
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, want to see?</font>

254
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a souvenir. Take a look.</font>

255
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've seen many wounds like that
in my village.</font>

256
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We call them the walking dead</font>

257
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because it takes about a week
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.</font>

258
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet,</font>

259
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">hooked up to a car battery,</font>

260
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.</font>

261
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right. Smile.</font>

262
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:02,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We met once, you know,
at a technical conference in Bern.</font>

263
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.</font>

264
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,</font>

265
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.</font>

266
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are we?</font>

267
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, stand up. Stand up!</font>

268
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just do as I do.</font>

269
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, put your hands up.</font>

270
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?</font>

271
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you understand me? Do as I do.</font>

272
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:53,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer</font>

273
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"in the history of America."</font>

274
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is honored.</font>

275
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wants you to build the missile.</font>

276
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.</font>

277
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one.</font>

278
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I refuse.</font>

279
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony!</font>

280
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wants to know what you think.</font>

281
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you got a lot of my weapons.</font>

282
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:39,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He says they have everything you need
to build the Jericho missile.</font>

283
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wants you to make
the list of materials.</font>

284
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He says for you
to start working immediately,</font>

285
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and when you're done,
he will set you free.</font>

286
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, he won't.
- No, he won't.</font>

287
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.</font>

288
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they will never find you
in these mountains.</font>

289
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:22,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, what you just saw,</font>

290
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that is your legacy, Stark.</font>

291
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your life's work,
in the hands of those murderers.</font>

292
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that how you want to go out?</font>

293
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:37,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?</font>

294
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or are you going to
do something about it?</font>

295
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:45,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me, you, either way.</font>

296
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.</font>

297
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then,</font>

298
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this is a very important week for you,
isn't it?</font>

299
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If this is going to be my work station,
I want it well-lit. I want these up.</font>

300
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need welding gear.
I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.</font>

301
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.</font>

302
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets of precision tools.</font>

303
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How many languages do you speak?
- A lot.</font>

304
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But apparently,
not enough for this place.</font>

305
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They speak Arabic, Urdu,</font>

306
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.</font>

307
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:38,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who are these people?
- They are your loyal customers, sir.</font>

308
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They call themselves the Ten Rings.</font>

309
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, we might be more productive</font>

310
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you include me
in the planning process.</font>

311
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, we don't need this.</font>

312
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

313
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's palladium, 0.15 grams.</font>

314
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:17,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?</font>

315
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's he doing?</font>

316
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Working.</font>

317
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful.
Careful, we only get one shot at this.</font>

318
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax. I have steady hands.</font>

319
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you think you're still alive?</font>

320
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:52,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.</font>

321
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yinsen. Nice to meet you.</font>

322
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice to meet you, too.</font>

323
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.</font>

324
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's because
it's a miniaturized arc reactor.</font>

325
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a big one
powering my factory at home.</font>

326
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.</font>

327
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what could it generate?</font>

328
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:56,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If my math is right, and it always is,
three gigajoules per second.</font>

329
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.</font>

330
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.</font>

331
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is our ticket out of here.
- What is it?</font>

332
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flatten them out and look.</font>

333
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wow.</font>

334
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Impressive.</font>

335
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

336
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good roll. Good roll.</font>

337
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still haven't told me
where you're from.</font>

338
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm from a small town called Gulmira.</font>

339
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's actually a nice place.
- Got a family?</font>

340
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:10,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.</font>

341
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you, Stark?</font>

342
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- No?</font>

343
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're a man who has everything</font>

344
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and nothing.</font>

345
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't look anything like the picture.</font>

346
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe it's been modified.</font>

347
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The tail is wrong.</font>

348
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just backwards.</font>

349
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax.</font>

350
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bow and arrow</font>

351
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.</font>

352
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It allowed the great Genghis Khan</font>

353
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.</font>

354
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:33,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great</font>

355
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and 4 times
the size of the Roman Empire.</font>

356
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But today,</font>

357
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whoever holds the latest Stark weapons</font>

358
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">rules these lands.</font>

359
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And soon,</font>

360
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it will be my turn.</font>

361
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why have you failed me?</font>

362
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're working.</font>

363
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Diligently.</font>

364
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I let you live.</font>

365
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is how you repay me?</font>

366
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's very complex.</font>

367
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's trying very hard.</font>

368
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On his knees.</font>

369
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think I'm a fool?</font>

370
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get the truth.</font>

371
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're both working.</font>

372
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open your mouth.</font>

373
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does he want?</font>

374
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think I'm a fool?</font>

375
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?</font>

376
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me the truth.</font>

377
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's building your Jericho.</font>

378
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want? A delivery date?</font>

379
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need him.</font>

380
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good assistant.</font>

381
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.</font>

382
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? Can you move?</font>

383
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, say it again.</font>

384
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,</font>

385
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's from the door,
fork right, 33 steps, turn right.</font>

386
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Stark?</font>

387
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was here a moment ago.</font>

388
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go look for him.</font>

389
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!</font>

390
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say something.
Say something back to him.</font>

391
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
- Then speak Hungarian.</font>

392
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay. I know.
- What do you know?</font>

393
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How'd that work?
- Oh, my goodness.</font>

394
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It worked all right.
- That's what I do.</font>

395
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let me finish this.
- Initialize the power sequence.</font>

396
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:54,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

397
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now!
- Tell me. Tell me.</font>

398
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Function 11.
Tell me when you see a progress bar.</font>

399
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It should be up right now.
- Yes.</font>

400
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:03,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.</font>

401
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I have it.
- Press Control "l".</font>

402
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- "I." Got it.
- "I." "Enter." "l" and "Enter."</font>

403
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come over here and button me up.</font>

404
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:13,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. All right.</font>

405
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every other hex bolt.</font>

406
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They're coming!
- Nothing pretty, just get it done.</font>

407
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just get it done.
- They're coming.</font>

408
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?</font>

409
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need more time.</font>

410
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey,</font>

411
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm gonna go buy you some time.
- Stick to the plan!</font>

412
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stick to the plan!</font>

413
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yinsen!</font>

414
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yinsen!
- Watch out!</font>

415
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stark.</font>

416
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. We got to go.</font>

417
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move for me, come on. We got a plan.
We're gonna stick to it.</font>

418
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was always the plan, Stark.</font>

419
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.</font>

420
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My family is dead.</font>

421
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to see them now, Stark.</font>

422
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

423
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want this. I want this.</font>

424
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for saving me.</font>

425
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:29,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.</font>

426
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My turn.</font>

427
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not bad.</font>

428
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

429
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How was the "fun-vee"?</font>

430
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next time, you ride with me, okay?</font>

431
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch it, coming up here.</font>

432
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:34,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.</font>

433
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your eyes are red.
A few tears for your long-lost boss?</font>

434
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:50,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
- Yeah, vacation's over.</font>

435
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where to, sir?</font>

436
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
- No.</font>

437
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No? Tony, you have to</font>

438
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- go to the hospital.
- No is a complete answer.</font>

439
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The doctor has to look at you.
- I don't have to do anything.</font>

440
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been in captivity for 3 months.</font>

441
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:04,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,</font>

442
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and the other...
- That's enough of that.</font>

443
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.</font>

444
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Call for a press conference?
- Yeah.</font>

445
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What on earth for?
- Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.</font>

446
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this!</font>

447
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony.</font>

448
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We were going to meet at the hospital.
- No, I'm fine.</font>

449
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at you!</font>

450
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You had to have a burger, yeah?
- Well, come on.</font>

451
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You get me one of those?
- There's only one left. I need it.</font>

452
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, look who's here! Yeah!</font>

453
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Miss Potts?
- Yes.</font>

454
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I speak to you for a moment?</font>

455
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:59,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.</font>

456
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a reporter.</font>

457
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Agent Phil Coulson,</font>

458
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement</font>

459
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Logistics Division.</font>

460
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.</font>

461
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:13,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, we've been approached
already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...</font>

462
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.</font>

463
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to debrief Mr. Stark
about the circumstances of his escape.</font>

464
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:24,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll put something in the book, shall I?
- Thank you.</font>

465
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?</font>

466
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:35,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can...</font>

467
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little less formal and...</font>

468
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's up with the love-in?
- Don't look at me.</font>

469
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what he's up to.</font>

470
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.</font>

471
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never got to say goodbye to Dad.</font>

472
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:55,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never got to say goodbye to my father.</font>

473
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's questions
that I would have asked him.</font>

474
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would have asked him how he felt
about what this company did.</font>

475
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.</font>

476
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.</font>

477
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw young Americans killed</font>

478
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:24,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.</font>

479
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I saw</font>

480
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:33,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.</font>

481
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mr. Stark!
- Hey, Ben.</font>

482
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened over there?</font>

483
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:42,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that I have more</font>

484
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:46,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to offer this world
than just making things that blow up.</font>

485
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:50,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that is why, effective immediately,
I am shutting down</font>

486
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:54,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the weapons manufacturing division
of Stark International</font>

487
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:58,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until such a time as I can decide
what the future of the company will be.</font>

488
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we're gonna be selling
a lot of newspapers.</font>

489
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with</font>

490
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:05,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and is consistent with the highest good
for this country, as well.</font>

491
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:12,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What we should take away from this
is that Tony's back!</font>

492
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he's healthier than ever.</font>

493
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to have
a little internal discussion</font>

494
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we'll get back to you
with the follow-up.</font>

495
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where is he?
- He's inside.</font>

496
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that... That went well.</font>

497
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?</font>

498
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your head? What about my head?</font>

499
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?</font>

500
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:50,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Optimistically, 40 points.
- At minimum.</font>

501
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep.</font>

502
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:55,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.</font>

503
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Obie, I just don't want a body count
to be our only legacy.</font>

504
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what we do. We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.</font>

505
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:01,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my name on the side of the building.</font>

506
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what we do
keeps the world from falling into chaos.</font>

507
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not based on what I saw.</font>

508
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:08,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not doing a good enough job.</font>

509
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.</font>

510
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like what?
You want us to make baby bottles?</font>

511
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:17,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we should take another look
into arc reactor technology.</font>

512
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:21,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.
The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!</font>

513
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, come on. We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!</font>

514
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.</font>

515
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:32,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The arc was never cost effective.
We knew that before we built it.</font>

516
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?</font>

517
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.</font>

518
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?</font>

519
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 30 years.
- That's what they say.</font>

520
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?</font>

521
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Never mind who told me. Show me.
- It's Rhodey or Pepper.</font>

522
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.</font>

523
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Okay?</font>

524
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It works.</font>

525
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to me, Tony. We're a team.
Do you understand?</font>

526
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,</font>

527
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like your father and I.</font>

528
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?</font>

529
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But if I had...
- Tony.</font>

530
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.</font>

531
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.</font>

532
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta let me handle this.</font>

533
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna have to play
a whole different kind of ball now.</font>

534
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.</font>

535
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.</font>

536
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stark Industries!</font>

537
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?</font>

538
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sell, sell, sell!</font>

539
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Abandon ship!</font>

540
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:52,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?</font>

541
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:58,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!</font>

542
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:04,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!</font>

543
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pepper. How big are your hands?</font>

544
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- How big are your hands?</font>

545
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.</font>

546
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

547
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see them. Show me your hands.</font>

548
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see them.</font>

549
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.</font>

550
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just need your help for a sec.</font>

551
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?</font>

552
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was. It is now an antique.</font>

553
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what will be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.</font>

554
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:47,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,
and I just ran into a little speed bump.</font>

555
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Speed bump, what does that mean?
- It's nothing. It's just a little snag.</font>

556
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:53,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's an exposed wire
under this device.</font>

557
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.</font>

558
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fine.</font>

559
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:01,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do you want me to do?
- Put that on the table over there.</font>

560
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God!</font>

561
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:07,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to reach in, and you're just
gonna gently lift the wire out.</font>

562
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.</font>

563
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch</font>

564
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the socket wall or it goes "beep."</font>

565
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do you mean, "Operation"?
- It's just a game, never mind.</font>

566
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:20,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
- Okay.</font>

567
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.</font>

568
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:28,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you're fine.
You're the most capable, qualified,</font>

569
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">trustworthy person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.</font>

570
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it too much of a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...</font>

571
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.</font>

572
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

573
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, there's pus!</font>

574
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:50,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,</font>

575
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- not from my body.
- It smells!</font>

576
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it does.</font>

577
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?</font>

578
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, I got it! I got it!
- Okay, you got it?</font>

579
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, don't let it touch the sides
when you're coming out!</font>

580
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</font>

581
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what
I was trying to tell you before.</font>

582
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, now make sure
that when you pull it out, you don't...</font>

583
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:08,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it. You just pulled it out.</font>

584
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, God!
- Okay, I was not expecting...</font>

585
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
- Okay, what do I do?</font>

586
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong?</font>

587
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing,
I'm just going into cardiac arrest</font>

588
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause you yanked it out like a trout...</font>

589
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What? You said it was safe!
- We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.</font>

590
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You gotta switch it out really quick.
- Okay. Okay.</font>

591
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tony? It's going to be okay.
- What?</font>

592
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.</font>

593
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.</font>

594
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:31,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you're gonna attach that
to the base plate. Make sure you...</font>

595
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:39,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was that so hard? That was fun, right?
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.</font>

596
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice.</font>

597
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.</font>

598
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

599
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't ever, ever, ever,</font>

600
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:52,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.</font>

601
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have anyone but you.</font>

602
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway...</font>

603
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do you want me to do with this?
- That?</font>

604
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Destroy it.</font>

605
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Incinerate it.</font>

606
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want to keep it?</font>

607
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:21,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pepper, I've been called many things.
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.</font>

608
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That will be all, Miss Potts.</font>

609
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Butterfingers, come here.</font>

610
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?</font>

611
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:33,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my phone,
that's a picture of me and my dad.</font>

612
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:36,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.</font>

613
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:46,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?</font>

614
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell you, in my experience,</font>

615
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:53,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,</font>

616
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">his insight,</font>

617
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that ability to look
into a situation beyond the obvious</font>

618
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:02,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.</font>

619
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel?
Why not a pilot without the plane?</font>

620
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.</font>

621
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello, sir.
- Speaking of manned or unmanned,</font>

622
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong</font>

623
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:14,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at spring break.
Just remember that, spring break, 1987.</font>

624
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That lovely lady you woke up with.
- Don't do that!</font>

625
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What was his name?
- Don't do that.</font>

626
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Was it Ivan?
- Don't do that.</font>

00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll believe it. Don't do that.</font>

628
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Don't do that.</font>

629
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pleasure meeting you.
- Give us a couple minutes, you guys.</font>

630
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm surprised.
- Why?</font>

631
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:31,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear, I didn't expect to see you
walking around so soon.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm doing a little better than walking.</font>

633
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really?
- Yeah.</font>

634
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rhodey, I'm working on something big.</font>

635
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:41,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.</font>

636
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're about to make a whole
lot of people around here real happy,</font>

637
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:47,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,</font>

638
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,516

639

<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not for the military. I'm not...
It's different.</font>

or something?</font>

641
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I need you to listen to me.
- No.</font>

642
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:02,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you need is time
to get your mind right.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to open a new project file,
index as Mark II.</font>

648
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:33,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall I store this on
the Stark Industries Central Database?</font>

649
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.</font>

650
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Till further notice, why don't we just
keep everything on my private server?</font>

651
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Working on a secret project,
are we, sir?</font>

652
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:48,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.</font>

653
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:53,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe in mine,
it can actually do some good.</font>

654
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:39,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next. Up.</font>

655
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:42,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here.
You got me?</font>

656
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay put. Nice.</font>

657
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.</font>

658
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?</font>

659
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up.</font>

660
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Screw it. Don't even move.</font>

661
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:07,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are a tragedy.</font>

662
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let's do this right.</font>

663
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.</font>

664
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby for fire safety.</font>

665
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, roll it.</font>

666
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:35,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Activate hand controls.</font>

667
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:40,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna start off nice and easy.</font>

668
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna see if
10% thrust capacity achieves lift.</font>

669
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And 3,</font>

670
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2,</font>

671
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1.</font>

672
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up two. All right, set that.</font>

673
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?</font>

674
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, everything's... What?</font>

675
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great!</font>

676
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What would you like me to tell him?
- Great. I'll be right up.</font>

677
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

678
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you said
you were done making weapons.</font>

679
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:41,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is.</font>

680
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:46,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.</font>

681
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't expect that.</font>

682
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd it go?</font>

683
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It went that bad, huh?</font>

684
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just because I brought pizza
back from New York</font>

685
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:08,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.</font>

686
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:11,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would have gone better
if you were there.</font>

687
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.</font>

688
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:17,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I lay low, and you take care of all...
- Hey, come on. In public. The press.</font>

689
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:23,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This was a board of directors meeting.
- This was a board of directors meeting?</font>

690
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The board is claiming
you have posttraumatic stress.</font>

691
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:27,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're filing an injunction.</font>

692
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:30,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A what?
- They want to lock you out.</font>

693
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?</font>

694
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We knew that was gonna happen.</font>

695
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 56 and a half.
- It doesn't matter.</font>

696
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We own the controlling interest
in the company.</font>

697
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, the board has rights, too.</font>

698
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:44,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're making the case
that you and your new direction</font>

699
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- isn't in the company's best interest.
- I'm being responsible!</font>

700
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a new direction for me,
for the company.</font>

701
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:54,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...</font>

702
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:55,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is great.</font>

703
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:59,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
- I'll be in the shop.</font>

704
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.</font>

705
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:05,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.</font>

706
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something to pitch them.</font>

707
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:10,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me have the engineers analyze that.
You know, draw up some specs.</font>

708
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No. No, absolutely not.
- It'll give me a bone to throw the boys</font>

709
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- in New York!
- This one stays with me.</font>

710
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:17,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's it, Obie. Forget it.
- All right, well, this stays with me, then.</font>

711
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:19,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on, here, you can have a piece.</font>

712
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Take two.
- Thank you.</font>

713
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?</font>

714
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good night, Obie.</font>

715
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:29,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,</font>

716
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,</font>

717
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:35,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.</font>

718
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, nice and easy.</font>

719
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:42,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.</font>

720
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:46,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And three, two, one.</font>

721
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:58,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

722
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't follow me around
with it, either,</font>

723
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:04,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.</font>

724
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.</font>

725
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:08,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.</font>

726
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:10,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3, 2, 1.</font>

727
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, this is where I don't want to be!</font>

728
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not the car, not the car!</font>

729
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Table!</font>

730
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:48,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.</font>

731
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

732
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I can fly.</font>

733
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:19,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.</font>

734
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:21,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Engage Heads Up Display.
- Check.</font>

735
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Import all preferences
from home interface.</font>

736
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will do, sir.</font>

737
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:33,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, what do you say?</font>

738
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:36,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have indeed been uploaded, sir.
We're online and ready.</font>

739
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:38,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we start the virtual walk-around?</font>

740
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Importing preferences
and calibrating virtual environment.</font>

741
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do a check on control surfaces.</font>

742
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you wish.</font>

743
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:09,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.</font>

744
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:12,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.</font>

745
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Start listening in on ground control.</font>

746
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:14,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, there are still terabytes</font>

747
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of calculations needed
before an actual flight is...</font>

748
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:21,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.</font>

749
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:25,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready? In 3, 2, 1.</font>

750
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Handles like a dream.</font>

751
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's see what
this thing can do.</font>

752
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:22,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's SR-71's record?</font>

753
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:26,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The altitude record for fixed wing flight
is 85,000 feet, sir.</font>

754
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:29,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Records are made to be broken!
Come on!</font>

755
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:36,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, there is a potentially fatal
buildup of ice occurring.</font>

756
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:37,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep going!</font>

757
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Higher!</font>

758
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:58,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!</font>

759
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, we got to break the ice!</font>

760
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kill power.</font>

761
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:07,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish
at plus 40 altitude.</font>

762
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:12,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hull pressurization is problematic.
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.</font>

763
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:14,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A very astute observation, sir.</font>

764
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:16,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,</font>

765
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we should improve the exosystems.</font>

766
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:20,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Connect to the sys. Co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.</font>

767
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:24,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.</font>

768
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:27,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That should ensure a fuselage integrity
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.</font>

769
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Got it?
- Yes.</font>

770
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:31,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall I render
using proposed specifications?</font>

771
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thrill me.</font>

772
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:39,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right
here at the Disney Concert Hall,</font>

773
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:43,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where Tony Stark's third annual benefit
for the Firefighter's Family Fund</font>

774
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,125

for L.A.'s high society.</font>

775
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:46,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis, we get an invite for that?</font>

776
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:49,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no record of an invitation, sir.</font>

01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...hasn't been seen in public</font>

778
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:54,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.</font>

779
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:57,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some claim he's suffering
from posttraumatic stress</font>

780
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and has been bedridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,</font>

781
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:04,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.</font>

783
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little ostentatious, don't you think?</font>

784
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:11,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.</font>

785
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:15,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell you what.
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.</font>

786
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, that should help you
keep a low profile.</font>

787
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:23,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The render is complete.</font>

788
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:26,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.</font>

789
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:27,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Commencing automated assembly.</font>

790
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:30,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Estimated completion time is 5 hours.</font>

791
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't wait up for me, honey.</font>

792
01:07:56,363 --> 01:08:00,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weapons manufacturing is only
one small part of what Stark Industries</font>

793
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:03,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is all about, and our partnership
with the fire and rescue community...</font>

794
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:09,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, Tony, remember me?
- Sure don't.</font>

795
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look great, Hef.</font>

796
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:15,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to have a great quarter.</font>

797
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:19,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?</font>

798
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:23,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.</font>

799
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you inside.</font>

800
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:29,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right?</font>

801
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I got the board
right where we want them.</font>

802
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:34,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.</font>

803
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:42,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
- Mr. Stark?</font>

804
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.</font>

805
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...</font>

806
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:51,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.</font>

807
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:52,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, you need a new name for that.</font>

808
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:55,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I hear that a lot.</font>

809
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I know this must be a trying time
for you, but we need to debrief you.</font>

810
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:01,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's still
a lot of unanswered questions,</font>

811
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:03,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and time can be a factor
with these things.</font>

812
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:05,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just put something on the books.</font>

813
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:09,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m.
At Stark Industries?</font>

814
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:12,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell you what.
You got it. You're absolutely right.</font>

815
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:17,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm going to go to my assistant,
and we'll make a date.</font>

816
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:20,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.</font>

817
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:23,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing here?
- Just avoiding government agents.</font>

818
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you by yourself?
- Yes. Where'd you get that dress?</font>

819
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, it was a birthday present.
- That's great.</font>

820
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:29,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- From you, actually.
- Well, I got great taste.</font>

821
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:30,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

822
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You want to dance?
- Oh, no.</font>

823
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:35,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right, come on.
- Thank you. No.</font>

824
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I making you uncomfortable?</font>

825
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:53,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss</font>

826
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:57,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in front of everyone that I work with
in a dress with no back.</font>

827
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:00,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You look great and you smell great.
- Oh, God.</font>

828
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:02,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I could fire you if that would
take the edge off.</font>

829
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:05,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I actually don't think that
you could tie your shoes without me.</font>

830
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:07,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'd make it a week. Sure.
- Really?</font>

831
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:09,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your Social Security number?</font>

832
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 5.
- 5?</font>

833
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right.
- Right.</font>

834
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:19,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're missing just
a couple of digits there.</font>

835
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other 8?
So I got you for the other 8.</font>

836
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:38,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.</font>

837
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:42,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.</font>

838
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was totally not harmless, by the way.</font>

839
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:46,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're dancing. No one's even watching.</font>

840
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:48,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?</font>

841
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:52,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... People... We just danced.</font>

842
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:55,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it was not just a dance. You don't
understand because you're you.</font>

843
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:58,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And everybody knows
exactly who you are</font>

844
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and how you are with girls
and all of that, which is completely fine.</font>

845
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, you know, then me, you're my boss,</font>

846
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:06,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and I'm dancing with you.
- I don't think it was taken that way.</font>

847
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:09,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...</font>

848
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:11,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I just think you're overstating it.
- You know, and we're here,</font>

849
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:15,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then I'm wearing this ridiculous</font>

850
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:17,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">dress, and then we were dancing
like that and...</font>

851
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:34,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it, okay.</font>

852
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:39,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I would like a vodka martini, please.
- Okay.</font>

853
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:43,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.</font>

854
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:47,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.</font>

855
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:50,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make one of them dirty, will you?</font>

856
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:57,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. Tony Stark.</font>

857
01:11:57,604 --> 01:11:59,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, hey.
- Fancy seeing you here.</font>

858
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:04,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Carrie.
- Christine.</font>

859
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

860
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:08,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.</font>

861
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:10,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I at least get a reaction from you?</font>

862
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.</font>

863
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:14,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I was referring
to your company's</font>

864
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:15,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">involvement in this latest atrocity.</font>

865
01:12:15,789 --> 01:12:18,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. They just put my name on the
invitation. I don't know what to tell you.</font>

866
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.</font>

867
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:23,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was out of town for a couple months,
in case you didn't hear.</font>

868
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this what you call accountability?</font>

869
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?</font>

870
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.</font>

871
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:44,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.</font>

872
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm not my company.</font>

873
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:51,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?</font>

874
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's going on in Gulmira?
- Tony, Tony.</font>

875
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:56,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You can't afford to be this naive.
- You know what? I was naive before,</font>

876
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:58,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when they said,
"Here's the line. We don't cross it.</font>

877
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"This is how we do business."</font>

878
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:02,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we're double-dealing under the table...
Are we?</font>

879
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:05,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, your picture, please!</font>

880
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:11,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's take a picture. Come on.
Picture time!</font>

881
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:16,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony. Who do you think locked you out?</font>

882
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:20,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.</font>

883
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:25,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was the only way I could protect you.</font>

884
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:28,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No.</font>

885
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:41,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of Gulmira can only be described</font>

886
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:45,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a descent into hell,
into a modern day Heart of Darkness.</font>

887
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:48,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages</font>

888
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:49,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have been driven from their homes,</font>

889
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:54,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">displaced from their lands by warlords
emboldened by a new-found power.</font>

890
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:57,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Villagers have been forced to take
shelter in whatever crude dwellings</font>

891
01:13:57,641 --> 01:14:00,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they can find in the ruins
of other villages,</font>

892
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:04,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or here in the remnants
of an old Soviet smelting plant.</font>

893
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:12,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Recent violence has been attributed
to a group of foreign fighters</font>

894
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:15,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.</font>

895
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:18,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.</font>

896
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:23,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.</font>

897
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:25,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With no political will
or international pressure,</font>

898
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:28,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's very little hope
for these refugees.</font>

899
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:31,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Around me, a woman begging for news
on her husband,</font>

900

who will stop.</font>

904
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:46,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A child's simple question,
"Where are my mother and father?"</font>

905
01:14:47,941 --> 01:14:50,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's very little hope
for these refugees,</font>

906
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:54,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">refugees who can only wonder who,
if anyone, will help.</font>

907
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry it up.</font>

908
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:29,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put the women in the trucks.</font>

909
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:30,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stack the weapons here.</font>

910
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:31,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clear all the houses.</font>

911
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:33,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That one there.
Faster. Faster.</font>

912
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:42,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab that dog.</font>

913
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put him with the others.</font>

914
01:16:58,822 --> 01:17:00,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is this?</font>

915
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:13,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoot this dog.</font>

916
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're all incompetent.</font>

917
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:19,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn your head.</font>

918
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:28,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's all yours.</font>

919
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:29,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?</font>

920
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:31,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.</font>

921
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:33,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.</font>

922
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:34,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get those monitors up!</font>

923
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:36,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got a bogey!</font>

924
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:38,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wasn't Air Force!
- We got the CIA on the line?</font>

925
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:40,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.</font>

926
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:42,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it definitely is not us, sir!</font>

927
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:43,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It wasn't Navy.
- Wasn't Marines.</font>

928
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:46,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?</font>

929
01:19:46,656 --> 01:19:48,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Negative, negative.
- Cannot identify.</font>

930
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:51,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me Colonel Rhodes from
Weapons Development down here now!</font>

931
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced</font>

932
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with all known databases.
We have nothing.</font>

933
01:20:02,088 --> 01:20:04,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any high altitude surveillance
in the region?</font>

934
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:06,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk in the area.</font>

935
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:07,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So this thing just appeared
out of nowhere?</font>

936
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:09,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How come it didn't show up
on the radar?</font>

937
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:11,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.</font>

938
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:13,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is it stealth?
- No, sir, it's tiny.</font>

939
01:20:13,725 --> 01:20:16,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.</font>

940
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:17,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel, what are we dealing with here?</font>

941
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:23,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let me make a call.
- Sergeant, clear a hole.</font>

942
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello?
- Tony?</font>

943
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who's this?
- It's Rhodes.</font>

944
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:32,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry, hello?
- I said it's Rhodes.</font>

945
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:35,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Speak up, please.
- What in the hell is that noise?</font>

946
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:39,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
- Yeah, well, I need your help right now.</font>

947
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:40,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's funny how that works, huh?</font>

948
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:44,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up</font>

949
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.</font>

950
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:47,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's a hot spot.</font>

951
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:50,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you, huh?</font>

952
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:51,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?</font>

953
01:20:51,721 --> 01:20:52,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.</font>

954
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:54,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I thought you were driving.
- Right, I was driving</font>

955
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:56,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.</font>

956
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:59,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?</font>

957
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:00,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nope!
- Bogey spotted!</font>

958
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:03,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Whiplash, come in hot.
- Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one</font>

959
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:06,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">right now, and it's about to be blown
to kingdom come.</font>

960
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my exit.</font>

961
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:17,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sights.</font>

962
01:21:17,789 --> 01:21:19,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whiplash One, what is it?</font>

963
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:20,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got no idea.</font>

964
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:23,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You have radio contact?
- Non responsive, sir.</font>

965
01:21:23,169 --> 01:21:24,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you are clear to engage.</font>

966
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:27,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hit it.</font>

967
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:35,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!</font>

968
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:41,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Inbound missile.
- Flares!</font>

969
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:46,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!</font>

970
01:22:01,041 --> 01:22:02,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deploy flaps!</font>

971
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:04,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy!</font>

972
01:22:04,794 --> 01:22:06,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.</font>

973
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:08,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sat visual has been lost.</font>

974
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:09,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way that's a UAV.</font>

975
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:11,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

976
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:12,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't see anything.</font>

977
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:15,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.</font>

978
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think bogey's been handled, sir.</font>

979
01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:29,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello?
- Hi, Rhodey, it's me.</font>

980
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's who?
- I'm sorry, it is me.</font>

981
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:32,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You asked.
What you were asking about is me.</font>

982
01:22:32,572 --> 01:22:34,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, see, this isn't a game.</font>

983
01:22:34,157 --> 01:22:37,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.</font>

984
01:22:37,535 --> 01:22:39,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You understand that?
- This is not a piece of equipment.</font>

985
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:42,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!</font>

986
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:44,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rhodey, you got anything for me?</font>

987
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:49,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mark your position and return to base.
- Roger that, Ballroom.</font>

988
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:52,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On your belly!</font>

989
01:22:52,884 --> 01:22:54,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks like a man!</font>

990
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shake him off! Roll! Roll!</font>

991
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:06,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm hit! I'm hit!</font>

992
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:09,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's confirmed. He has been hit.</font>

993
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:15,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Punch out! Punch out!</font>

994
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:23,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whiplash One down.</font>

995
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:25,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?</font>

996
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Negative! No chute, no chute!</font>

997
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My chute's jammed!</font>

998
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:42,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.</font>

999
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:45,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whiplash Two, reengage.
If you get a clear shot, you take it.</font>

1000
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.</font>

1001
01:23:49,941 --> 01:23:52,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Call off the Raptors.
- That thing just took out an F-22</font>

01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">inside a legal no fly zone!</font>

1003
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whiplash Two,
if you have a clear shot, take it!</font>

1004
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:58,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.</font>

1005
01:23:58,408 --> 01:23:59,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep going!</font>

1006
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:09,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good chute! Good chute!</font>

1007
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tony, you still there?
- Hey, thanks.</font>

1008
01:24:19,971 --> 01:24:22,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.</font>

1009
01:24:23,349 --> 01:24:24,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?</font>

1010
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:29,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.</font>

1011
01:24:29,105 --> 01:24:30,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?</font>

1012
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:33,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.</font>

1013
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:35,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?</font>

1014
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:37,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?</font>

1015
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:39,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not that simple.</font>

1016
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:42,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An unfortunate training exercise</font>

1017
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:45,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">involving an F-22 Raptor

that the pilot was not injured.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">As for the unexpected turn of events
on the ground in Gulmira,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">it is still unclear
who or what intervened,</font>

1021
01:24:57,175 --> 01:25:01,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I can assure you that the United
States government was not involved.</font>

1022
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:04,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1023
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is a tight fit, sir.</font>

1024
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:12,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.</font>

1025
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:14,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be gentle. This is my first time.</font>

1026
01:25:15,026 --> 01:25:17,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I designed this to come off, so... Hey.</font>

1027
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:22,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I really should be able to...
- Please, try not to move, sir.</font>

1028
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:26,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on here?</font>

1029
01:25:31,251 --> 01:25:35,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.</font>

1030
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are those bullet holes?</font>

1031
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:06,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome.</font>

1032

01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:16,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.</font>

1034
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:18,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.</font>

1035
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:20,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show me the weapon.</font>

1036
01:26:21,759 --> 01:26:25,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come. Leave your guards outside.</font>

1037
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His escape bore unexpected fruit.</font>

1038
01:26:47,243 --> 01:26:49,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So this is how he did it.</font>

1039
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:52,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is only a first, crude effort.</font>

1040
01:26:52,248 --> 01:26:54,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stark has perfected his design.</font>

1041
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:57,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has made a masterpiece of death.</font>

1042
01:26:58,129 --> 01:27:01,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.</font>

1043
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:05,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you dream of Stark's throne.</font>

1044
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a common enemy.</font>

1045
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:15,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we are still in business,</font>

1046
01:27:18,107 --> 01:27:20,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will give you these designs</font>

1047
01:27:21,819 --> 01:27:22,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a gift.</font>

1048
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:25,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And in turn,</font>

1049
01:27:27,533 --> 01:27:32,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.</font>

1050
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:46,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the only gift you shall receive.</font>

1051
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:50,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Technology.</font>

1052
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:56,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's always been your Achilles' heel
in this part of the world.</font>

1053
01:27:57,563 --> 01:28:00,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. It'll only last for 15 minutes.</font>

1054
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:04,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the least of your problems.</font>

1055
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:12,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crate up the armor and the rest of it.</font>

1056
01:28:13,871 --> 01:28:15,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's finish up here.</font>

1057
01:28:19,877 --> 01:28:22,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Set up Sector 16
underneath the arc reactor,</font>

1058
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:26,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm going to want this data masked.
Recruit our top engineers.</font>

1059
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:28,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want a prototype right away.</font>

1060
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:39,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?</font>

1061
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:42,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to go to my office.</font>

1062
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:44,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve all</font>

1063
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:47,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.</font>

1064
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:49,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This'll get you in.</font>

1065
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:50,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's probably under Executive Files.</font>

1066
01:28:51,075 --> 01:28:53,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If not, they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need</font>

1067
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:56,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to look for the lowest numeric heading.</font>

1068
01:28:56,539 --> 01:28:58,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what do you plan to do with
this information if I bring it back here?</font>

1069
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:00,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Same drill.</font>

1070
01:29:00,251 --> 01:29:02,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've been dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.</font>

1071
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:05,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.</font>

1072
01:29:06,382 --> 01:29:07,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony,</font>

1073
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:11,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you know that
I would help you with anything,</font>

1074
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:15,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I cannot help you if
you're going to start all of this again.</font>

1075
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:19,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.</font>

1076
01:29:19,645 --> 01:29:22,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.</font>

1077
01:29:23,983 --> 01:29:27,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is the next mission
and nothing else.</font>

1078
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:29,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that so?</font>

1079
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:33,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then, I quit.</font>

1080
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:37,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stood by my side all these years</font>

1081
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:40,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">while I reaped
the benefits of destruction.</font>

1082
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now that I'm trying
to protect the people</font>

1083
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:44,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?</font>

1084
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:49,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not going to be a part of it.</font>

1085
01:29:49,592 --> 01:29:51,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shouldn't be alive,</font>

1086
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:55,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">unless it was for a reason.</font>

1087
01:29:55,848 --> 01:29:57,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not crazy, Pepper.</font>

1088
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:01,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just finally know what I have to do.</font>

1089
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:08,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I know in my heart that it's right.</font>

1090
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're all I have, too, you know.</font>

1091
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:41,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?</font>

1092
01:31:53,966 --> 01:31:58,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did not tell us that the target you
paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.</font>

1093
01:31:58,387 --> 01:31:59,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- As you can see, Obadiah Stane...
- Oh, my God.</font>

1094
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:02,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.</font>

1095
01:32:02,808 --> 01:32:05,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.</font>

1096
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:13,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what are we going to do about this?</font>

1097
01:32:25,915 --> 01:32:29,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what you're going through,
Pepper.</font>

1098
01:32:36,926 --> 01:32:40,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony. He always gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?</font>

1099
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:06,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was so happy when he came home.</font>

1100
01:33:06,706 --> 01:33:09,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was like we got him back
from the dead.</font>

1101
01:33:12,545 --> 01:33:14,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I realize,</font>

1102
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:20,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?</font>

1103
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:24,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He left a part of himself in that cave.</font>

1104
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:28,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Breaks my heart.</font>

1105
01:33:31,188 --> 01:33:35,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he's a complicated person.</font>

1106
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:41,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.</font>

1107
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:50,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are a very rare woman.</font>

1108
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:55,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.</font>

1109
01:33:57,757 --> 01:33:59,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. Thanks.</font>

1110
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:03,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd better get back there.</font>

1111
01:34:09,268 --> 01:34:11,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that today's paper?</font>

1112
01:34:12,938 --> 01:34:14,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1113
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:16,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you mind?</font>

1114
01:34:16,776 --> 01:34:18,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not at all.
- Puzzle.</font>

1115
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:20,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

1116
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:24,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take care.</font>

1117
01:34:48,974 --> 01:34:51,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Potts? We had an appointment.
Did you forget about our appointment?</font>

1118
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:53,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope, right now. Come with me.</font>

1119
01:34:53,562 --> 01:34:54,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right now?
- We're going to have it right now.</font>

1120
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:56,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, walk with me.
- Okay.</font>

1121
01:34:57,733 --> 01:34:59,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.</font>

1122
01:35:01,445 --> 01:35:04,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.</font>

1123
01:35:04,657 --> 01:35:08,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely, we're...
I'm going to have to call you back.</font>

1124
01:35:08,411 --> 01:35:11,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored</font>

1125
01:35:11,163 --> 01:35:13,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.</font>

1126
01:35:13,499 --> 01:35:15,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Actually...
- A hiccup?</font>

1127
01:35:15,292 --> 01:35:19,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, to power the suit, sir,
the technology actually doesn't exist.</font>

1128
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:22,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So it's...
- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?</font>

1129
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:28,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">William, here is the technology.
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.</font>

1130
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:32,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.</font>

1131
01:35:32,685 --> 01:35:39,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony Stark was able to build this
in a cave! With a box of scraps!</font>

1132
01:35:41,485 --> 01:35:44,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.</font>

1133
01:36:00,671 --> 01:36:01,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony?</font>

1134
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:07,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, are you there? Hello?</font>

1135
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:10,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Breathe.</font>

1136
01:36:11,682 --> 01:36:14,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy, easy.</font>

1137
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You remember this one, right?</font>

1138
01:36:20,524 --> 01:36:22,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.</font>

1139
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:27,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.</font>

1140
01:36:29,366 --> 01:36:30,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony.</font>

1141
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:37,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I ordered the hit on you,</font>

1142
01:36:39,919 --> 01:36:42,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I worried that I was</font>

1143
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:47,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">killing the golden goose.</font>

1144
01:36:48,844 --> 01:36:52,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, you see, it was just</font>

1145
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:56,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">fate that you survived that.</font>

1146
01:37:01,273 --> 01:37:05,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had one last golden egg to give.</font>

1147
01:37:09,323 --> 01:37:14,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?</font>

1148
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:23,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father, he helped give us
the atomic bomb.</font>

1149
01:37:23,754 --> 01:37:28,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?</font>

1150
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:39,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's beautiful.</font>

1151
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:47,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.</font>

1152
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:51,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a masterpiece. Look at that.</font>

1153
01:37:53,242 --> 01:37:54,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is your legacy.</font>

1154
01:37:57,538 --> 01:38:02,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.</font>

1155
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:09,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weapons that will help steer the world
back on course,</font>

1156
01:38:09,758 --> 01:38:12,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">put the balance of power in our hands.</font>

1157
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:15,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The right hands.</font>

1158
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:22,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish you could see my prototype.</font>

1159
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:25,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not as...</font>

1160
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:30,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, not as conservative as yours.</font>

1161
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:34,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too bad you had to involve Pepper
in this.</font>

1162
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:38,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would have preferred that she lived.</font>

1163
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:53,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?</font>

1164
01:38:53,427 --> 01:38:56,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...</font>

1165
01:38:57,306 --> 01:38:58,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, where's Tony now?</font>

1166
01:38:58,682 --> 01:39:00,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.</font>

1167
01:39:00,476 --> 01:39:02,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please go over there
and make sure everything's okay.</font>

1168
01:39:02,686 --> 01:39:05,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.</font>

1169
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:12,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good boy.</font>

1170
01:40:52,755 --> 01:41:03,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony?</font>

1171
01:41:06,393 --> 01:41:07,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony!</font>

1172
01:41:09,688 --> 01:41:11,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony! You okay?</font>

1173
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:15,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where's Pepper?
- She's fine. She's with 5 agents.</font>

1174
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:18,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're about to arrest Obadiah.</font>

1175
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:20,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not going to be enough.</font>

1176
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:50,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Section 16. Section 16. There it is.</font>

1177
01:41:59,446 --> 01:42:02,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.</font>

1178
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:04,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?</font>

1179
01:42:04,451 --> 01:42:05,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's, like, a thing that's going
to pick the lock?</font>

1180
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:08,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might want to take
a few steps back.</font>

1181
01:42:27,266 --> 01:42:29,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.</font>

1182
01:42:29,893 --> 01:42:32,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not bad, huh? Let's do it.</font>

1183
01:42:39,361 --> 01:42:41,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need me to do anything else?</font>

1184
01:42:42,322 --> 01:42:44,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep the skies clear.</font>

1185
01:42:49,246 --> 01:42:50,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn!</font>

1186
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:00,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next time, baby.</font>

1187
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:33,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.</font>

1188
01:43:34,333 --> 01:43:36,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought it'd be bigger.</font>

1189
01:44:21,171 --> 01:44:22,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take him out!</font>

1190
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:35,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you think the Mark I
chest piece is going to hold up?</font>

1191
01:44:35,143 --> 01:44:37,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.</font>

1192
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:40,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That chest piece
was never designed for sustained flight.</font>

1193
01:44:40,315 --> 01:44:41,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep me posted.</font>

1194
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:44,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pepper!</font>

1195
01:44:44,695 --> 01:44:47,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tony! Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine. How are...</font>

1196
01:44:47,781 --> 01:44:49,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Obadiah, he's gone insane!
- I know.</font>

1197
01:44:49,783 --> 01:44:51,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Listen, you'd better get out of there.
- He built a suit.</font>

1198
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:53,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of there right now!</font>

1199
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:07,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do you think you're going?</font>

1200
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:15,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your services are no longer required.</font>

1201
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:17,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stane!</font>

1202
01:45:42,669 --> 01:45:44,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love this suit!</font>

1203
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:47,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Put them down!
- Collateral damage, Tony.</font>

1204
01:45:49,217 --> 01:45:51,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Divert power to chest RT.</font>

1205
01:45:59,978 --> 01:46:02,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Power reduced to 19%.</font>

1206
01:46:09,946 --> 01:46:11,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lady!</font>

1207
01:46:12,949 --> 01:46:14,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no, no, no!</font>

1208
01:46:37,057 --> 01:46:40,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For 30 years, I've been holding you up!</font>

1209
01:46:44,481 --> 01:46:46,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I built this company from nothing!</font>

1210
01:46:49,194 --> 01:46:51,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing is going to stand in my way.</font>

1211
01:46:58,036 --> 01:47:00,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Least of all you!</font>

1212
01:47:10,006 --> 01:47:13,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Impressive!
You've upgraded your armor!</font>

1213
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:16,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've made some upgrades of my own!</font>

1214
01:47:24,896 --> 01:47:26,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.</font>

1215
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:28,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Duly noted.
Take me to maximum altitude.</font>

1216
01:47:28,692 --> 01:47:30,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...</font>

1217
01:47:31,069 --> 01:47:33,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know the math! Do it!</font>

1218
01:47:41,538 --> 01:47:43,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, you're not going to believe this.
That thing is back.</font>

1219
01:47:43,915 --> 01:47:46,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!</font>

1220
01:47:49,254 --> 01:47:52,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.</font>

1221
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:53,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

1222
01:48:01,558 --> 01:48:03,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 13 percent power, sir.
- Climb!</font>

1223
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:09,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 11 percent.
- Keep going!</font>

1224
01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:18,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 7 percent power.
- Just leave it on the screen!</font>

1225
01:48:18,450 --> 01:48:20,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop telling me!</font>

1226
01:48:29,753 --> 01:48:34,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had a great idea, Tony, but my
suit is more advanced in every way!</font>

1227
01:48:34,925 --> 01:48:36,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you solve the icing problem?</font>

1228
01:48:37,052 --> 01:48:38,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Icing problem?</font>

1229
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:43,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Might want to look into it.</font>

1230
01:48:54,778 --> 01:48:56,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 percent.</font>

1231
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:01,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are now running
on emergency backup power.</font>

1232
01:49:12,754 --> 01:49:16,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Potts!
- Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?</font>

1233
01:49:16,299 --> 01:49:20,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm almost out of power. I've got to get
out of this thing. I'll be right there.</font>

1234
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice try!</font>

1235
01:49:34,484 --> 01:49:38,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Weapons status?
- Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.</font>

1236
01:49:42,867 --> 01:49:44,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flares!</font>

1237
01:49:52,961 --> 01:49:55,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very clever, Tony.</font>

1238
01:50:00,343 --> 01:50:02,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Potts?
- Tony!</font>

1239
01:50:02,887 --> 01:50:03,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't working.</font>

1240
01:50:03,972 --> 01:50:06,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.</font>

1241
01:50:06,349 --> 01:50:09,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, how are you going to do that?
- You're going to do it.</font>

1242
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:11,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.</font>

1243
01:50:11,855 --> 01:50:13,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.</font>

1244
01:50:13,356 --> 01:50:15,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to hit
the master bypass button.</font>

1245
01:50:16,026 --> 01:50:17,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's going to fry everything up here.</font>

1246
01:50:19,571 --> 01:50:21,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I'm going in now.</font>

1247
01:50:21,948 --> 01:50:25,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make sure you wait till I clear the roof.
I'll buy you some time.</font>

1248
01:50:34,711 --> 01:50:36,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This looks important!</font>

1249
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:00,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never had a taste for this sort of thing,</font>

1250
01:51:00,278 --> 01:51:04,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!</font>

1251
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:15,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You finally outdid yourself, Tony!</font>

1252
01:51:17,545 --> 01:51:19,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd have made your father proud!</font>

1253
01:51:24,636 --> 01:51:27,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!</font>

1254
01:51:46,658 --> 01:51:47,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony!</font>

1255
01:51:49,202 --> 01:51:50,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How ironic, Tony!</font>

1256
01:51:52,622 --> 01:51:57,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trying to rid the world of weapons,
you gave it its best one ever!</font>

1257
01:51:57,794 --> 01:52:03,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pepper!
- And now I'm going to kill you with it!</font>

1258
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:10,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You ripped out my targeting system!
- Time to hit the button!</font>

1259
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:14,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You told me not to!
- Hold still, you little prick!</font>

1260
01:52:16,688 --> 01:52:19,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just do it!
- You'll die!</font>

1261
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:23,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Push it!</font>

1262
01:53:21,419 --> 01:53:23,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony!</font>

1263
01:53:31,638 --> 01:53:33,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've all received the official
statement of what occurred</font>

1264
01:53:33,848 --> 01:53:36,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at Stark Industries last night.</font>

1265
01:53:36,476 --> 01:53:41,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned</font>

1266
01:53:41,105 --> 01:53:43,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and caused damage to the arc reactor.</font>

1267
01:53:44,442 --> 01:53:46,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fortunately, a member
of Tony Stark's personal security staff...</font>

1268
01:53:46,778 --> 01:53:48,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.</font>

1269
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:52,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, it's not technically accurate.
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,</font>

1270
01:53:52,534 --> 01:53:55,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.</font>

1271
01:53:55,245 --> 01:53:56,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's your alibi.</font>

1272
01:53:57,747 --> 01:53:58,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1273
01:53:58,915 --> 01:54:01,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You were on your yacht.
- Yeah.</font>

1274
01:54:01,167 --> 01:54:03,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have port papers that put you
in Avalon all night,</font>

1275
01:54:03,378 --> 01:54:05,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.</font>

1276
01:54:05,171 --> 01:54:08,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me</font>

1277
01:54:08,383 --> 01:54:10,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">alone on the island.</font>

1278
01:54:11,469 --> 01:54:12,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's what happened.
- All right.</font>

1279
01:54:12,846 --> 01:54:14,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just read it, word for word.</font>

1280
01:54:16,891 --> 01:54:18,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing about Stane here.</font>

1281
01:54:18,977 --> 01:54:21,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's being handled. He's on vacation.</font>

1282
01:54:22,647 --> 01:54:25,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Small aircraft have
such a poor safety record.</font>

1283
01:54:25,191 --> 01:54:27,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what about the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?</font>

1284
01:54:27,777 --> 01:54:30,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?</font>

1285
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:33,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.</font>

1286
01:54:33,157 --> 01:54:37,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just stick to the official statement,
and soon, this will all be behind you.</font>

1287
01:54:37,245 --> 01:54:39,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got 90 seconds.</font>

1288
01:54:42,375 --> 01:54:44,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Agent Coulson?</font>

1289
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:49,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wanted to say thank you very much
for all of your help.</font>

1290
01:54:49,299 --> 01:54:52,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.</font>

1291
01:54:52,468 --> 01:54:55,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.</font>

1292
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:57,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

1293
01:54:58,308 --> 01:55:02,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's get this show on the road.
- You know, it's actually not that bad.</font>

1294
01:55:02,312 --> 01:55:04,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.</font>

1295
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:06,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're not Iron Man.
- Am so.</font>

1296
01:55:06,316 --> 01:55:08,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're not.
- All right, suit yourself.</font>

1297
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:12,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have
this girlfriend who knew my true identity.</font>

1298
01:55:12,947 --> 01:55:15,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always
be worrying that I was going to die,</font>

1299
01:55:15,575 --> 01:55:17,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">yet so proud of the man I'd become.</font>

1300
01:55:18,036 --> 01:55:21,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more</font>

1301
01:55:23,499 --> 01:55:24,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">crazy about me.</font>

1302
01:55:24,626 --> 01:55:26,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me you never think about that night.</font>

1303
01:55:26,377 --> 01:55:28,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What night?
- You know.</font>

1304
01:55:31,174 --> 01:55:36,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,</font>

1305
01:55:38,598 --> 01:55:44,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,</font>

1306
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:47,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you left me there, by myself?</font>

1307
01:55:48,733 --> 01:55:51,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that the night you're talking about?</font>

1308
01:55:53,446 --> 01:55:54,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thought so.</font>

1309
01:55:57,241 --> 01:56:00,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.</font>

1310
01:56:01,079 --> 01:56:04,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.</font>

1311
01:56:04,707 --> 01:56:07,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He will not be taking any questions.
Thank you.</font>

1312
01:56:11,923 --> 01:56:17,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Been a while since I was in front of you.
I figure I'll stick to the cards this time.</font>

1313
01:56:19,013 --> 01:56:22,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred</font>

1314
01:56:22,141 --> 01:56:23,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the freeway and the rooftop...</font>

1315
01:56:23,518 --> 01:56:26,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that</font>

1316
01:56:26,396 --> 01:56:30,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,</font>

1317
01:56:30,233 --> 01:56:33,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- despite the fact that you...
- I know that it's confusing.</font>

1318
01:56:33,403 --> 01:56:37,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely</font>

1319
01:56:37,115 --> 01:56:40,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.</font>

1320
01:56:40,451 --> 01:56:42,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never said you were a superhero.</font>

1321
01:56:42,161 --> 01:56:47,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't? Well, good, because that would
be outlandish and fantastic.</font>

1322
01:56:49,502 --> 01:56:52,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.</font>

1323
01:56:53,297 --> 01:56:56,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With this laundry list
of character defects,</font>

1324
01:56:56,342 --> 01:56:57,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all the mistakes I've made,</font>

1325
01:56:57,885 --> 01:57:01,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- largely public.
- Just stick to the cards, man.</font>

1326
01:57:01,305 --> 01:57:02,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, okay. Yeah.</font>

1327
01:57:05,101 --> 01:57:06,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The truth is</font>

1328
01:57:12,775 --> 01:57:14,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Iron Man.</font>

1329
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:18,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis!</font>

1330
02:05:18,844 --> 02:05:20,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome home, sir.</font>

1331
02:05:24,016 --> 02:05:29,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I am Iron Man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?</font>

1332
02:05:29,855 --> 02:05:33,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stark, you've become part
of a bigger universe.</font>

1333
02:05:33,192 --> 02:05:34,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just don't know it yet.</font>

1334
02:05:35,486 --> 02:05:37,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the hell are you?</font>

1335
02:05:37,488 --> 02:05:40,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.</font>

1336
02:05:42,284 --> 02:05:45,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.</font>
