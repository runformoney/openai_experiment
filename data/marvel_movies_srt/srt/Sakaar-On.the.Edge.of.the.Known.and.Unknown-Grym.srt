And we're stranded on a planet
that is designed to stress me out.

6

It's lawless and chaotic,

Sakaar couldn't be more different
than Asgard in every respect.

20
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:21,248
<i>It's a hyper-color

He kind of runs the place.

38
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:09,838
Sakaar is ruled by the Grandmaster,
played by Jeff Goldblum.

39

He does things with disco.

Grandmaster improvises.
One, two, three, four...

Marvel's Contest of Champions

73
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,684
With Hulk's history in the comics
of these cosmic adventures,

74
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,770
<i>we felt like, the perfect choice
to bring him into that Thor world.</i>

75
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:54,109
The idea of those two heroes together
is probably the one thing that got me

76
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,461
the most excited about the project.

77
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,737
You're Banner's friend.

78
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,072
I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.

79
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,991
Thor, Banner's friend.

80
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,035
Hulk's no longer depending
on Banner's anger.

81
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,495
Hulk trains.

Hey, big guy-

84
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:11,501
On Sakaar, he's a huge star.
He's a prizefighter.

85
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:15,714
<i>And he gets the penthouse suite
and anything he wants, basically.</i>

86
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,382
This is Hulk's suite.

87
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,011
<i>Hulk's bed is basically
an old dragon's skull.</i>

<i>Something that he's put together,
a bit of a prize.</i>

<i>He's the guy who can afford
whatever he wants</i>

<i>and space is of a premium in Sakaar.</i>

92
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,772

Hulk's a lot more articulate in this
movie than we've ever seen him before.

96
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,657
I'm sorry.
I just get so angry all the time.

Hulk always angry.

98
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,622
Hulk is a CG character, but because
we capture Mark's performance,

99
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,541
<i>he has a nuanced way of being</i>

100
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,710
<i>that you don't expect

Mark Ruffalo brings the gravity
to Bruce Banner.

104
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,769
Mark Ruffalo reinvented Banner,
reinvented the Hulk.

105
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,189
<i>His playfulness, I think, is what

108
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,070
It varies from moment to moment.

109
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,994
It was very fun to see, for
the first time, Loki and Hulk reunited

110
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,139
<i>under very different circumstances than

I am a god, you dull creature.

112
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:42,968
One of my favorite things in this film
is Loki's response to Hulk smashing Thor

113
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,387
<i>in exactly the same way

That's how it feels! Whoo!
You feel that?

116
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,520
Come on, this place is perfect for you.

117
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,939
It's savage, it's chaotic, it's lawless.

<i>and the other second he's doing
something that serves only himself.</i>

124
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,583
There's a bit of a running gag in
the comic books and the previous films

125
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,858
<i>about Thor's trusting him again

Classic Loki.

131
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,780
THOR: There was one time
when we were children...

132
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,324
he transformed himself into a snake,
and he knows I love snakes.

133
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,392
So, I went to pick up the snake
to admire it...

134
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,079
and he transformed back into himself
and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"

135
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,354
And he stabbed me.

136
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,900
In Ragnarok, actually, Thor has sort of
cottoned on to the cycle.

137
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,570
<i>And Loki has to adapt

I think, inherently,
there is good in Loki.

00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:54,414
<i>But he just has a warped view
and entitlement.</i>

00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,739
having a shared universe.

156
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,325
<i>Where anybody could show up
in anybody else's book.</i>

157
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,534
Yes!

158
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,704
Kevin Feige and all the guys at Marvel
always love going somewhere different.

159
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,289
<i>Just had to see where we can take it.</i>

160
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,874
(SCREAMING)

161
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,295
In these films,
they are able to find new ways

162
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,506
<i>of those characters interacting
and fighting</i>

163
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,884
<i>and teaming up and having a laugh
in all kinds of new places.</i>

164
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:48,969
Get help!

165
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,887
Classic.

166
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,651
- It's humiliating.
- Not for me, it's not.

167
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,808
<i>HEMSWORTH: And Sakaar is
the perfect coming together</i>

168
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,726
of these characters
in the Marvel Universe.

169
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,855
<i>It's my birthday
It's my birthday</i>

170
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:08,530
This wasteland world of Sakaar is
the wild, epic space-adventure aspect

171
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,373
<i>of Thor that we haven't seen
onscreen before.</i>

172
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,867
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus!
