1
00:00:07,163 --> 00:00:10,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, hold on, don't shoot.</font>

2
00:00:10,967 --> 00:00:12,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You see where you're going?
- Mm-hmm.</font>

3
00:00:12,902 --> 00:00:13,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

4
00:00:14,036 --> 00:00:16,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, let's worry
about how you get there.</font>

5
00:00:16,872 --> 00:00:18,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotta move your foot here.</font>

6
00:00:18,808 --> 00:00:20,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Point your toe this way.</font>

7
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:22,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your hips here.</font>

8
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:23,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay?</font>

9
00:00:24,513 --> 00:00:25,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can you see?
- Yeah.</font>

10
00:00:25,948 --> 00:00:27,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.</font>

11
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about now? Can you see now?</font>

12
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:30,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- How about now?</font>

13
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:33,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

14
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:35,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready? 3 fingers.</font>

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice!</font>

16
00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:40,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice throw, kiddo.</font>

17
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here you go.</font>

18
00:00:42,298 --> 00:00:44,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you guys
want mayo? Or mustard?</font>

19
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:46,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or both?</font>

20
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who puts mayo on a hot dog?</font>

21
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:49,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably your brothers.</font>

22
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:51,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, two mustard, please!
Thanks, Mama.</font>

23
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:53,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it!</font>

24
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:55,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nate, mayo or mustard?</font>

25
00:00:55,578 --> 00:00:57,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about ketchup?</font>

26
00:00:57,078 --> 00:00:59,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or ketchup. I got ketchup, too.</font>

27
00:00:59,482 --> 00:01:00,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind your elbow.</font>

28
00:01:02,618 --> 00:01:04,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good job, hawk-eye.</font>

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go get your arrow.</font>

30
00:01:09,592 --> 00:01:10,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guys!</font>

31
00:01:10,726 --> 00:01:13,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enough practice. Soup's on!</font>

32
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:14,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

33
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:15,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're coming. We're hungry.</font>

34
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:18,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lila, let's go.</font>

35
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:22,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lila?</font>

36
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:26,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey?</font>

37
00:01:30,412 --> 00:01:31,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, babe?</font>

38
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:42,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Babe?</font>

39
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:45,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Babe?</font>

40
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:48,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boys!</font>

41
00:01:50,332 --> 00:01:51,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boys!</font>

42
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:54,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laura!</font>

43
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:40,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't need to do that.</font>

44
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because, uh, you're just
holding the position.</font>

45
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font>

46
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was close.</font>

47
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:50,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a goal.
We are now one apiece.</font>

48
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:51,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would like to try again.</font>

49
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:56,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're tied up. Feel the tension?</font>

50
00:02:56,563 --> 00:02:58,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fun.</font>

51
00:02:58,131 --> 00:03:00,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was terrible.
Now you have a chance to win.</font>

52
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:02,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you've won.</font>

53
00:03:03,604 --> 00:03:04,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations.</font>

54
00:03:04,872 --> 00:03:06,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fair game.</font>

55
00:03:07,507 --> 00:03:08,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good sport.</font>

56
00:03:09,743 --> 00:03:11,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have fun?</font>

57
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:15,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was fun.</font>

58
00:03:37,537 --> 00:03:39,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This thing on?</font>

59
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:43,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.</font>

60
00:03:44,377 --> 00:03:47,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you find this recording...</font>

61
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">don't post it on social media.</font>

62
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:52,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna be a real tearjerker.</font>

63
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:55,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know if you're
ever gonna see these.</font>

64
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't even know
if you're still...</font>

65
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, I hope so.</font>

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Today's day 21.</i></font>

00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:05,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No, uh, 22.</i></font>

68
00:04:05,631 --> 00:04:08,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You know, if it wasn't for
the existential terror...</i></font>

69
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>of staring into
the literal void of space,</i></font>

70
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:13,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'd say I'm feeling
a little better today.</i></font>

71
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:14,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Infection's run its course,</i></font>

72
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:16,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>thanks to
the Blue Meanie back there.</i></font>

73
00:04:16,809 --> 00:04:18,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, you'd love her.</i></font>

74
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Very practical.</i></font>

75
00:04:20,312 --> 00:04:22,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Only a tiny bit sadistic.</i></font>

76
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:29,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So, the fuel cells were
cracked during battle...</i></font>

77
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:31,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and we figured out a way
to reverse the ion charge...</i></font>

78
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:35,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and bought ourselves about
48 hours of flight time.</i></font>

79
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:40,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Uh, but it's now dead
in the water.</i></font>

80
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:43,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Thousand light years

85
00:04:58,984 --> 00:05:00,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>to pull off one last one.</i></font>

86
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:03,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But it looks like...</i></font>

87
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Well, you know
what it looks like.</i></font>

88
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't feel bad about this.</font>

89
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, actually, if you
grovel for a couple weeks...</font>

90
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:15,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then move on
with enormous guilt...</font>

91
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should probably lie down
for a minute.</font>

92
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go rest my eyes.</font>

93
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:29,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please know...</font>

94
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:33,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I drift off, it'll be
like every night lately.</font>

95
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:36,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine. Totally fine.</font>

96
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I dream about you.</font>

97
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:41,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because it's always you.</font>

98
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:05,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Couldn't stop him.</font>

99
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:06,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neither could I.</font>

100
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:08,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on.</font>

101
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:12,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lost the kid.</font>

102
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:16,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, we lost.</font>

103
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:19,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is, uh...?</font>

104
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:22,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, good.
- Oh, my God!</font>

105

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

106
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:31,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

107
00:09:37,556 --> 00:09:40,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been 23 days
since Thanos came to Earth.</font>

108
00:09:42,427 --> 00:09:45,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">World governments are in pieces.</font>

still working...</font>

110
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:50,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are trying to take a census
and it looks like he did...</font>

111
00:09:53,438 --> 00:09:55,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He did exactly what he said
he was gonna do.</font>

112
00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:56,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos wiped out...</font>

113
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">50% of all living creatures.</font>

114
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:08,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is he now? Where?</font>

115
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't know.</font>

116
00:10:10,022 --> 00:10:13,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just opened a portal
and walked through.</font>

117
00:10:15,994 --> 00:10:17,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong with him?</font>

118
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:20,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, he's pissed.</font>

119
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:21,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He thinks he failed.</font>

120
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:24,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which, of course, he did...</font>

121
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:26,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but there's a lot of that
going around, ain't there?</font>

122
00:10:26,404 --> 00:10:27,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honestly,
until this exact second</font>

123
00:10:27,806 --> 00:10:29,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you were
a Build-A-Bear.</font>

124
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:30,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I am.</font>

125
00:10:30,642 --> 00:10:32,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been hunting Thanos
for 3 weeks now.</font>

126
00:10:32,277 --> 00:10:34,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deep space scans...</font>

127
00:10:34,478 --> 00:10:36,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and satellites,
and we got nothing.</font>

128
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:39,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, you fought him.</font>

129
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who told you that?</font>

130
00:10:41,086 --> 00:10:42,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't fight him.</font>

131
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:43,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he wiped my face
with a planet...</font>

132
00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:45,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">while the Bleecker Street
magician</font>

133
00:10:45,257 --> 00:10:46,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">gave away the store.</font>

134
00:10:46,524 --> 00:10:47,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what happened.</font>

135
00:10:47,758 --> 00:10:49,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was no fight,
'cause he's not beatable.</font>

136
00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:51,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he give you any clues,
any coordinates, anything?</font>

137
00:10:51,964 --> 00:10:53,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

138
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:56,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw this coming
a few years back.</font>

139
00:10:56,434 --> 00:10:58,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.</font>

140
00:10:58,536 --> 00:11:00,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thought I was dreaming.</font>

141
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, I'm gonna
need you to focus.</font>

142
00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:03,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I needed you.</font>

143
00:11:03,308 --> 00:11:04,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As in, past tense.</font>

144
00:11:04,508 --> 00:11:08,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That trumps what you need.
It's too late, buddy.</font>

145
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:09,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

146
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I need?
I need a shave.</font>

147
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:15,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I believe I remember
telling all youse...</font>

148
00:11:15,987 --> 00:11:16,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, Tony!</font>

149
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:20,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alive and otherwise,
that what we needed</font>

150
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:22,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was a suit of armor
around the world.</font>

151
00:11:22,493 --> 00:11:23,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember that?</font>

152
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:26,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whether it impacted
our precious freedoms or not.</font>

153
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:27,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what we needed.</font>

154
00:11:27,698 --> 00:11:29,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that didn't
work out, did it?</font>

155
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:30,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said we'd lose.</font>

156
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:33,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said, "We'll do that
together, too."</font>

157
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:34,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And guess what, Cap?</font>

158
00:11:34,705 --> 00:11:36,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We lost.</font>

159
00:11:36,307 --> 00:11:37,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you weren't there.</font>

160
00:11:38,776 --> 00:11:40,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that's what we do, right?</font>

161
00:11:40,077 --> 00:11:42,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our best work after the fact?
We're the "Avengers."</font>

162
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're the "Avengers,"
not the "Pre-vengers."</font>

163
00:11:45,283 --> 00:11:46,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Right?</font>

164
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?</font>

165
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:48,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. No, no, here's my point.
You know what?</font>

166
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:50,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She's great by the way.
- Tony, you're sick. Sit down.</font>

167
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:52,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need you. You're new blood.</font>

168
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:55,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bunch of tired old mules.
I got nothing for you, Cap.</font>

169
00:11:55,293 --> 00:11:56,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got no coordinates...</font>

170
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no clues, no strategies,
no options.</font>

171
00:11:59,596 --> 00:12:01,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zero. Zip. Nada.</font>

172
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:03,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No trust, liar.</font>

173
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:09,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, take this.</font>

174
00:12:09,272 --> 00:12:11,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You find him, you put that on...</font>

175
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:13,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you hide.</font>

176
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:16,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tony!
- I'm fine.</font>

177
00:12:16,713 --> 00:12:18,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me...</font>

178
00:12:24,688 --> 00:12:26,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bruce gave him a sedative.</font>

179
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:28,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gonna probably be out
for the rest of the day.</font>

180
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:30,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys take care of him...</font>

181
00:12:30,592 --> 00:12:32,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'll bring him a Xorrian
elixir when I come back.</font>

182
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:34,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you going?</font>

183
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To kill Thanos.</font>

184
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

185
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:42,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, we usually work
as a team here...</font>

186
00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:43,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and, uh, between you and I,
morale's a little fragile.</font>

187
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We realize up there
is more your territory,</font>

188
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:47,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but this is our fight, too.</font>

189
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You even know where he is?</font>

190
00:12:49,212 --> 00:12:50,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know people who might.</font>

191
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't bother.</font>

192
00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:54,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can tell you where Thanos is.</font>

193
00:12:56,952 --> 00:13:00,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.</font>

194
00:13:00,622 --> 00:13:04,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when he worked,
he talked about his Great Plan.</font>

195
00:13:04,793 --> 00:13:08,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.</font>

196
00:13:08,197 --> 00:13:09,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd ask...</font>

197
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:13,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where would we go
once his plan was complete?</font>

198
00:13:13,302 --> 00:13:15,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And his answer
was always the same.</font>

199
00:13:19,475 --> 00:13:21,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"To the Garden."</font>

200
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.</font>

201
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:25,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, where is he?</font>

202
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:28,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When Thanos snapped
his fingers...</font>

203
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:30,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Earth became ground zero
for a power surge</font>

204
00:13:30,285 --> 00:13:32,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of ridiculously
cosmic proportions.</font>

205
00:13:32,254 --> 00:13:34,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one's ever seen
anything like it.</font>

206
00:13:34,555 --> 00:13:36,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until 2 days ago...</font>

207
00:13:37,893 --> 00:13:39,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on this planet.</font>

208
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:41,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos is there.</font>

209
00:13:43,298 --> 00:13:45,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He used the stones again.</font>

210
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:46,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, hey.</font>

211
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:49,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'd be going in
shorthanded, you know?</font>

212
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, he's still
got the stones, so...</font>

213
00:13:50,671 --> 00:13:52,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, let's get 'em.</font>

214
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:54,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Use them to bring everyone back.</font>

215
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:55,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like that?</font>

216
00:13:55,277 --> 00:13:56,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Just like that.</font>

217
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:00,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...</font>

218
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:03,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.</font>

219
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:04,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we do this, how do we know</font>

220
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:07,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's gonna end any differently
than it did before?</font>

221
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:09,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because before
you didn't have me.</font>

222
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:11,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, new girl?</font>

223
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:14,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody in this room
is about that superhero life.</font>

224
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:15,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you don't mind my asking,</font>

225
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:17,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where the hell
have you been all this time?</font>

226
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are a lot of other
planets in the universe.</font>

227
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And unfortunately,
they didn't have you guys.</font>

228
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:44,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like this one.</font>

229
00:14:48,563 --> 00:14:51,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go get
this son of a bitch.</font>

230
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

231
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:16,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who here hasn't been to space?</font>

232
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:19,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

233
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You better not throw up
on my ship.</font>

234
00:15:21,194 --> 00:15:22,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Approaching jump in 3...</font>

235
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2, 1.</font>

236
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:40,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'll head down for recon.</i></font>

237
00:15:58,465 --> 00:16:00,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is gonna work, Steve.</font>

238
00:16:00,132 --> 00:16:01,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it will.</font>

239
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:08,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.</font>

240
00:16:08,174 --> 00:16:11,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No satellites.
No ships. No armies.</i></font>

241
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:13,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No ground defenses of any kind.</i></font>

242
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:17,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It's just him.</i></font>

243
00:16:17,816 --> 00:16:19,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's enough.</font>

244
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:50,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

245
00:17:59,751 --> 00:18:01,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are they?</font>

246
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:03,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Answer the question.</font>

247
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:08,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The universe
required correction.</font>

248
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:12,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After that, the stones
served no purpose...</font>

249
00:18:12,229 --> 00:18:13,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">beyond temptation.</font>

250
00:18:13,864 --> 00:18:16,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You murdered trillions!</font>

251
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should be grateful.</font>

252
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:24,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are the stones?</font>

253
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gone.</font>

254
00:18:26,343 --> 00:18:27,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reduced to atoms.</font>

255
00:18:27,943 --> 00:18:29,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You used them 2 days ago!</font>

256
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used the stones
to destroy the stones.</font>

257
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It nearly killed me.</font>

258
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:38,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the work is done.</font>

259
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:41,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It always will be.</font>

260
00:18:43,225 --> 00:18:46,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am inevitable.</font>

261
00:18:48,565 --> 00:18:51,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to tear this place apart.
He has to be lying!</font>

262
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father is many things.</font>

263
00:18:53,469 --> 00:18:55,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A liar is not one of them.</font>

264
00:18:57,573 --> 00:18:58,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah.</font>

265
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:01,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, daughter.</font>

266
00:19:03,713 --> 00:19:05,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps I treated you
too harshly.</font>

267
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:13,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

268
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:15,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you do?</font>

269
00:19:17,026 --> 00:19:19,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I went for the head.</font>

270
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:32,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So...</i></font>

271
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, uh, went on a date
the other day.</font>

272
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:37,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the first time
in 5 years.</font>

273
00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:40,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know? I'm sitting there
at dinner.</font>

274
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't even know
what to talk about.</font>

275
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:46,244

00:31:12,862 --> 00:31:14,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only to make conversation.</font>

413
00:31:15,532 --> 00:31:17,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, so...</font>

414
00:31:17,534 --> 00:31:20,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 years ago, right before...</font>

415
00:31:20,969 --> 00:31:22,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos...</font>

416
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was in a place called
the quantum realm.</font>

417
00:31:24,374 --> 00:31:27,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The quantum realm is like
its own microscopic universe.</font>

418
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To get in there,
you have to be incredibly small.</font>

419
00:31:29,546 --> 00:31:31,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope. She's my, um...</font>

420
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:35,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was my...</font>

421
00:31:36,585 --> 00:31:37,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was supposed to pull me out.</font>

422
00:31:37,886 --> 00:31:39,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then Thanos happened...</font>

423
00:31:39,688 --> 00:31:41,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I got stuck in there.</font>

424
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, that must have
been a very long 5 years.</font>

425
00:31:43,892 --> 00:31:45,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but that's just it.</font>

426
00:31:45,495 --> 00:31:46,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't.</font>

427
00:31:46,762 --> 00:31:48,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For me, it was 5 hours.</font>

428
00:31:48,063 --> 00:31:49,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, the rules
of the quantum realm</font>

429
00:31:49,598 --> 00:31:50,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">aren't like they are up here.</font>

430
00:31:50,732 --> 00:31:52,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything is unpredictable.</font>

431
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:54,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that anybody's sandwich?</font>

432
00:31:54,002 --> 00:31:55,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm starving.</font>

433
00:31:55,471 --> 00:31:56,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott.</font>

434
00:31:56,705 --> 00:31:58,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?</font>

435
00:31:59,141 --> 00:32:00,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So...</font>

436
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what I'm saying is...</font>

437
00:32:03,678 --> 00:32:06,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">time works differently
in the quantum realm.</font>

438
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:08,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only problem is right now</font>

439
00:32:08,117 --> 00:32:09,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we don't have a way
to navigate it.</font>

440
00:32:09,717 --> 00:32:11,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what if we did?</font>

441
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't stop thinking about it.</font>

442
00:32:12,753 --> 00:32:14,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if we could somehow
control the chaos...</font>

443
00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:16,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we could navigate it?</font>

444
00:32:16,258 --> 00:32:17,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if there was a way...</font>

445
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:19,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that we could enter
the quantum realm</font>

446
00:32:19,561 --> 00:32:20,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at a certain point in time...</font>

447
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:22,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but then exit the quantum realm</font>

448
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:23,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at another point in time?</font>

449
00:32:23,664 --> 00:32:25,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like...</font>

450
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:27,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Like before Thanos.
- Wait.</font>

451
00:32:27,935 --> 00:32:29,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you talking
about a time machine?</font>

452
00:32:29,737 --> 00:32:32,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.</font>

453
00:32:32,673 --> 00:32:33,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is more like a...</font>

454
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Like a time machine.</font>

455
00:32:37,812 --> 00:32:39,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, it's crazy. It's crazy.</font>

456
00:32:39,714 --> 00:32:42,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I can't stop
thinking about it.</font>

457
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:43,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's got to be...</font>

458
00:32:43,885 --> 00:32:45,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">some way...</font>

459
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:47,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's crazy.
- Scott.</font>

460
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:48,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get emails from a raccoon...</font>

461
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:51,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so nothing sounds crazy anymore.</font>

462
00:32:51,592 --> 00:32:53,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, who do we talk to
about this?</font>

463
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chow time!</font>

464
00:33:15,516 --> 00:33:16,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maguna.</font>

465
00:33:20,787 --> 00:33:22,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morgan H. Stark,
you want some lunch?</font>

466
00:33:23,324 --> 00:33:24,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Define "lunch"</i></font>

467
00:33:24,392 --> 00:33:25,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- <i>or be disintegrated.</i>
- Okay.</font>

468
00:33:26,893 --> 00:33:28,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should not be
wearing that, okay?</font>

469
00:33:28,596 --> 00:33:30,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is part of a special
anniversary gift</font>

470
00:33:30,163 --> 00:33:31,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm making for Mom.</font>

471
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:37,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you go.
You thinking about lunch?</font>

472
00:33:37,438 --> 00:33:39,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.</font>

473
00:33:39,706 --> 00:33:41,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- That's what you want.</font>

474
00:33:41,609 --> 00:33:43,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you find this?</font>

475
00:33:43,843 --> 00:33:45,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Garage.
- Really?</font>

476
00:33:45,845 --> 00:33:48,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Were you looking for it?
- No.</font>

477
00:33:48,748 --> 00:33:50,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I found it, though.
- Hmm.</font>

478
00:33:50,784 --> 00:33:52,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like going in
the garage, huh?</font>

479
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:54,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So does Daddy.</font>

480
00:33:54,521 --> 00:33:57,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fine, actually.
Mom never wears anything I buy her.</font>

481
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I'm gonna...</font>

482
00:34:18,978 --> 00:34:21,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. We know what it sounds like.</font>

483
00:34:21,681 --> 00:34:22,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, after everything
you've seen,</font>

484
00:34:22,781 --> 00:34:24,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is anything really impossible?</font>

485
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:26,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale...</font>

486
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:27,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.</font>

487
00:34:27,953 --> 00:34:29,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we agree on that?</font>

488
00:34:29,321 --> 00:34:30,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

489
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:32,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In layman's terms,
it means you're not coming home.</font>

490
00:34:32,891 --> 00:34:34,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I did.
- No.</font>

491
00:34:34,226 --> 00:34:36,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You accidentally survived.</font>

492
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:38,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.</font>

493
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?</font>

494
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:45,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A time heist?</font>

495
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, a time heist. Of course.</font>

496
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:48,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't we think
of this before?</font>

497
00:34:48,841 --> 00:34:51,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.</font>

498
00:34:51,477 --> 00:34:53,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The stones are in the past.</font>

499
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could go back,
we could get them.</font>

500
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.</font>

501
00:34:57,449 --> 00:34:59,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?</font>

502
00:34:59,718 --> 00:35:01,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't believe we would.</font>

503
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:04,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotta say it. I sometimes
miss that giddy optimism.</font>

504
00:35:04,723 --> 00:35:06,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, high hopes
won't help...</font>

505
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:08,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if there's no logical,
tangible way</font>

506
00:35:08,661 --> 00:35:12,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for me to safely execute
said time heist.</font>

507
00:35:12,164 --> 00:35:14,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe
the most likely outcome</font>

508
00:35:14,132 --> 00:35:15,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will be our collective demise.</font>

509
00:35:15,467 --> 00:35:18,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.</font>

510
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:21,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right? It means no
talking to our past selves...</font>

511
00:35:21,005 --> 00:35:22,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no betting on sporting events.</font>

512
00:35:22,775 --> 00:35:24,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.</font>

513
00:35:25,511 --> 00:35:26,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you seriously telling me</font>

514
00:35:26,878 --> 00:35:28,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that your plan
to save the universe...</font>

515
00:35:28,846 --> 00:35:30,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is based on <i>Back to the Future?</i></font>

516
00:35:31,684 --> 00:35:33,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is it?
- No.</font>

517
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:34,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. You had me worried there.</font>

518
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause that would be horseshit.</font>

519
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:38,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not how
quantum physics works.</font>

520
00:35:38,456 --> 00:35:39,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony.</font>

521
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:43,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to take a stand.</font>

522
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:45,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We did stand.
And yet, here we are.</font>

523
00:35:47,832 --> 00:35:49,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you got
a lot on the line.</font>

524
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:52,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a wife, a daughter.</font>

525
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:54,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I lost someone
very important to me.</font>

526
00:35:54,972 --> 00:35:56,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lotta people did.</font>

527
00:35:56,574 --> 00:35:59,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...</font>

528
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to bring everyone back,</font>

529
00:36:01,112 --> 00:36:02,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're telling me
that you won't even...</font>

530
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right, Scott.
I won't even.</font>

531
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't.</font>

532
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:12,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy told me
to come and save you.</font>

533
00:36:12,323 --> 00:36:15,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good job. I'm saved.</font>

534
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:17,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.</font>

535
00:36:17,562 --> 00:36:18,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything else.</font>

536
00:36:18,563 --> 00:36:20,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, I just...</font>

537
00:36:20,631 --> 00:36:21,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, look, the table's
set for 6.</font>

538
00:36:21,998 --> 00:36:23,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony. I get it.</font>

539
00:36:23,735 --> 00:36:26,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm happy for you.
I really am.</font>

540
00:36:26,804 --> 00:36:28,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this is a second chance.</font>

541
00:36:28,972 --> 00:36:31,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got my second chance
right here, Cap.</font>

542
00:36:31,642 --> 00:36:33,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't roll the dice on it.</font>

543
00:36:35,145 --> 00:36:37,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.</font>

544
00:36:40,484 --> 00:36:42,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he's scared.</font>

545
00:36:42,386 --> 00:36:43,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not wrong.</font>

546
00:36:43,387 --> 00:36:45,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?</font>

547
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:47,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?</font>

548
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:50,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I wanna do it right.</font>

549
00:36:53,029 --> 00:36:54,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna need
a really big brain.</font>

550
00:36:55,832 --> 00:36:57,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bigger than his?</font>

551
00:36:57,534 --> 00:36:59,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, I feel like I'm
the only one eating here.</font>

552
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:00,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try some of that.</font>

553
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have some eggs.</font>

554
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:03,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so confused.</font>

555
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are confusing times.</font>

556
00:37:05,175 --> 00:37:07,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, no, no.
That's not what I meant.</font>

557
00:37:07,244 --> 00:37:10,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!</font>

558
00:37:10,514 --> 00:37:12,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, it's crazy.</font>

559
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:13,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm wearing shirts now.</font>

560
00:37:13,784 --> 00:37:17,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. What? How? Why?</font>

561
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:19,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 years ago,
we got our asses beat.</font>

562
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:21,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except it was worse for me...</font>

563
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:23,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause I lost twice.</font>

564
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:25,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...</font>

565
00:37:25,862 --> 00:37:27,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then, we all lost.</font>

566
00:37:27,196 --> 00:37:28,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one blamed you, Bruce.</font>

567
00:37:28,732 --> 00:37:30,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did.</font>

568
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For years, I've been
treating the Hulk</font>

569
00:37:33,102 --> 00:37:34,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like he's some kind
of disease...</font>

570
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">something to get rid of.</font>

571
00:37:36,439 --> 00:37:39,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.</font>

572
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:42,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">18 months
in the gamma lab.</font>

573
00:37:42,077 --> 00:37:44,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I put the brains
and the brawn together...</font>

574
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now, look at me.</font>

575
00:37:47,116 --> 00:37:49,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Best of both worlds.</font>

576
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:50,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes.</font>

577
00:37:50,786 --> 00:37:52,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we get a photo?</font>

578
00:37:52,588 --> 00:37:54,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">100%, little person.</font>

579
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:57,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?</font>

580
00:37:57,326 --> 00:37:59,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Thanks.</font>

581
00:37:59,395 --> 00:38:00,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say "green."</font>

582
00:38:00,995 --> 00:38:03,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Green.
- Green.</font>

583
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:04,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you get that?</font>

584
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a good one.</font>

585
00:38:06,435 --> 00:38:09,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you want to grab one
with me? I'm Ant-Man.</font>

586
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.</font>

587
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nobody does.
- No, he wants you to take</font>

588
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:17,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- a picture with him.
- I don't want a picture.</font>

589
00:38:17,613 --> 00:38:18,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stranger danger.</font>

590
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.</font>

591
00:38:20,248 --> 00:38:21,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get it.
I don't want it, either.</font>

592
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:22,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But come on. The kid...</font>

593
00:38:22,685 --> 00:38:24,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want a picture
with them.</font>

594
00:38:24,152 --> 00:38:25,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.</font>

595
00:38:25,353 --> 00:38:26,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.</font>

596
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't want to do it.
- We can do it.</font>

597
00:38:28,256 --> 00:38:30,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, you feel bad.
- Take the goddamn phone.</font>

598
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

599
00:38:31,794 --> 00:38:33,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Mr. Hulk.</font>

600
00:38:33,194 --> 00:38:34,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it was great,
kids. Thank you very much.</font>

601
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:36,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hulk out!</font>

602
00:38:36,598 --> 00:38:37,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bruce.</font>

603
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:39,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dab.</font>

604
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bruce.
- Listen to your mom.</font>

605
00:38:41,436 --> 00:38:42,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She knows better.</font>

606
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About what we were saying.</font>

607
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:45,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

608
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:50,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whole time travel do-over?</font>

609
00:38:51,346 --> 00:38:55,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eh, guys, it's outside
of my area of expertise.</font>

610
00:38:55,717 --> 00:38:57,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you pulled this off.</font>

611
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:01,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.</font>

612
00:39:35,023 --> 00:39:36,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a mild inspiration.</font>

613
00:39:36,523 --> 00:39:38,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to see
if it checks out.</font>

614
00:39:38,026 --> 00:39:40,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I'd like to run one last sim</font>

615
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before we pack it in
for the night.</font>

616
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:45,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This time, in the shape
of a Mobius strip,</font>

617
00:39:45,032 --> 00:39:46,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">inverted, please.</font>

618
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Processing.</i></font>

619
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:53,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, give me the eigenvalue
of that particle...</font>

620
00:39:53,774 --> 00:39:55,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">factoring in spectral decomp.</font>

621
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:58,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That'll take a second.
<i>- Just a moment.</i></font>

622
00:39:58,712 --> 00:40:01,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...</font>

623
00:40:03,249 --> 00:40:04,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Model rendered.</i></font>

624
00:40:16,697 --> 00:40:17,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

625
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:19,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

626
00:40:23,202 --> 00:40:25,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you
doing up, little miss?</font>

627
00:40:25,104 --> 00:40:27,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shit.
- Nope. We don't say that.</font>

628
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only Mommy says that word.</font>

629
00:40:28,307 --> 00:40:29,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She coined it.
It belongs to her.</font>

630
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:31,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you up?</font>

631
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I've got some
important shit going on here!</font>

632
00:40:32,712 --> 00:40:33,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you think?</font>

633
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:35,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I got something on my mind.</font>

634
00:40:35,481 --> 00:40:37,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got something on my mind.</font>

635
00:40:37,084 --> 00:40:38,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was it juice pops?</font>

636
00:40:40,152 --> 00:40:41,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure was.</font>

637
00:40:42,855 --> 00:40:44,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's extortion. That's a word.</font>

638
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind you want?</font>

639
00:40:46,058 --> 00:40:47,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great minds think alike.</font>

640
00:40:47,193 --> 00:40:49,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Juice pops exactly...</font>

641
00:40:51,196 --> 00:40:52,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was on my mind.</font>

642
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:55,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You done? Yeah?</font>

643
00:40:55,568 --> 00:40:56,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you are.</font>

644
00:40:57,235 --> 00:40:58,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here. Wipe.</font>

645
00:41:01,107 --> 00:41:03,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. That face goes there.</font>

646
00:41:03,976 --> 00:41:05,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me a story.</font>

647
00:41:05,511 --> 00:41:06,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A story.</font>

648
00:41:06,912 --> 00:41:09,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed.
The end.</font>

649
00:41:09,715 --> 00:41:11,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is a horrible story.</font>

650
00:41:11,149 --> 00:41:13,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, that's
your favorite story.</font>

651
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:14,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Love you tons.</font>

652
00:41:16,856 --> 00:41:18,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you 3,000.</font>

653
00:41:19,925 --> 00:41:20,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

654
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:31,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3,000. That's crazy.</font>

655
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to bed or I'll sell
all your toys.</font>

656
00:41:35,273 --> 00:41:36,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Night night.</font>

657
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:38,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not that it's a competition...</font>

658
00:41:38,443 --> 00:41:40,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but she loves me 3,000.</font>

659
00:41:40,712 --> 00:41:41,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does she, now?</font>

660
00:41:41,713 --> 00:41:45,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were somewhere
in the low 6 to 900 range.</font>

661
00:41:50,989 --> 00:41:53,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatcha reading?</font>

662
00:41:53,091 --> 00:41:54,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a book on composting.</font>

663
00:41:54,793 --> 00:41:56,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's new with composting?</font>

664
00:41:58,228 --> 00:42:00,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Interesting science...
- I figured it out.</font>

665
00:42:01,533 --> 00:42:02,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way.</font>

666
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:04,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, you know,</font>

667
00:42:04,468 --> 00:42:06,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just so we're talking
about the same thing...</font>

668

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time travel.</font>

669
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

670
00:42:14,012 --> 00:42:15,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

671
00:42:19,084 --> 00:42:20,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's amazing...</font>

672
00:42:21,685 --> 00:42:22,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and terrifying.</font>

673
00:42:22,921 --> 00:42:24,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

674
00:42:31,729 --> 00:42:33,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got really lucky.</font>

675
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

676
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:35,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

677
00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:37,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot of people didn't.</font>

678
00:42:37,267 --> 00:42:38,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope. And I can't
help everybody.</font>

679
00:42:40,537 --> 00:42:42,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorta seems like you can.</font>

680
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:43,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not if I stop.</font>

681
00:42:44,775 --> 00:42:47,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can put a pin in it
right now and stop.</font>

682
00:42:48,712 --> 00:42:51,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony...
trying to get you to stop...</font>

683
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:54,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has been one of the few
failures of my entire life.</font>

684
00:42:58,989 --> 00:43:00,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something tells me...</font>

685
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:02,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should put it in a lockbox</font>

686
00:43:02,893 --> 00:43:04,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and drop it to the bottom
of the lake...</font>

687
00:43:05,863 --> 00:43:07,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and go to bed.</font>

688
00:43:13,336 --> 00:43:15,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But would you be able to rest?</font>

689
00:43:19,943 --> 00:43:23,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, here we go.
Time travel test number 1.</font>

690
00:43:23,746 --> 00:43:25,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott, fire up...</font>

691
00:43:26,816 --> 00:43:27,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the, uh, van thing.</font>

692
00:43:30,187 --> 00:43:31,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Breakers are set.</font>

693
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:33,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Emergency generators
are on standby.</font>

694
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:34,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good, because
if we blow the grid,</font>

695
00:43:34,991 --> 00:43:38,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to lose, uh,
Tiny here in the 1950s.</font>

696
00:43:38,427 --> 00:43:41,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excuse me?
- He's kidding.</font>

697
00:43:41,531 --> 00:43:43,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't say things like that.</font>

698
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:45,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a bad joke.</font>

699
00:43:47,236 --> 00:43:48,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were kidding, right?</font>

700
00:43:48,671 --> 00:43:51,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no idea.
We're talking about time travel here.</font>

701
00:43:51,574 --> 00:43:54,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Either it's all a joke,
or none of it is.</font>

702
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:55,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're good!</font>

703
00:43:55,978 --> 00:43:57,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your helmet on.</font>

704
00:43:57,747 --> 00:43:59,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott, I'm gonna
send you back a week...</font>

705
00:43:59,715 --> 00:44:01,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">let you walk around for an hour,</font>

706
00:44:01,483 --> 00:44:03,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then bring you back
in 10 seconds.</font>

707
00:44:03,219 --> 00:44:04,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make sense?</font>

708
00:44:04,954 --> 00:44:06,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfectly not confusing.</font>

709
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:08,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck, Scott. You got this.</font>

710
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:12,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right.
I do, Captain America.</font>

711
00:44:15,064 --> 00:44:20,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On a count of 3...
3, 2, 1.</font>

712
00:44:23,772 --> 00:44:25,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... Guys?</font>

713
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:27,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This doesn't feel right.</font>

714
00:44:27,409 --> 00:44:28,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this?</font>

715
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's going on?
- Who is that?</font>

716
00:44:29,544 --> 00:44:30,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hold on.
- Is that Scott?</font>

717
00:44:30,812 --> 00:44:31,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, it's Scott.</font>

718
00:44:34,516 --> 00:44:37,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's going on, Bruce?
- Oh, my back!</font>

719
00:44:37,285 --> 00:44:38,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is this?
- Hold on a second.</font>

720
00:44:38,353 --> 00:44:39,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could I get a little space here?</font>

721
00:44:39,521 --> 00:44:40,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can you bring him back?</font>

722
00:44:40,789 --> 00:44:41,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm working on it.</font>

723
00:44:48,864 --> 00:44:49,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a baby.</font>

724
00:44:49,798 --> 00:44:51,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's Scott.
- As a baby.</font>

725
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He'll grow.
- Bring Scott back.</font>

726
00:44:53,001 --> 00:44:54,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I say kill the power,
kill the power.</font>

727
00:44:54,836 --> 00:44:56,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

728
00:44:56,805 --> 00:44:58,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And... kill it!</font>

729
00:45:02,443 --> 00:45:04,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody peed my pants.</font>

730
00:45:04,346 --> 00:45:05,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, thank God.</font>

731
00:45:05,512 --> 00:45:08,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I don't know
if it was baby me or old me.</font>

732
00:45:12,153 --> 00:45:14,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or just me me.</font>

733
00:45:14,455 --> 00:45:15,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time travel!</font>

734
00:45:19,627 --> 00:45:20,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

735
00:45:22,163 --> 00:45:24,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see this as an absolute win.</font>

736
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why the long face?</font>

737
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:14,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me guess,
he turned into a baby.</font>

738
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?</font>

739
00:46:16,616 --> 00:46:18,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the EPR Paradox.</font>

740
00:46:18,785 --> 00:46:20,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Instead of pushing Lang
through time,</font>

741
00:46:20,053 --> 00:46:21,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you might've wound up...</font>

742
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:22,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">pushing time through Lang.</font>

743
00:46:22,622 --> 00:46:23,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's tricky, dangerous.</font>

744
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody could have
cautioned you against it.</font>

745
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did.</font>

746
00:46:26,793 --> 00:46:28,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, did I?</font>

747
00:46:28,094 --> 00:46:29,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, thank God I'm here.</font>

748
00:46:30,463 --> 00:46:32,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Regardless, I fixed it.</font>

749
00:46:33,032 --> 00:46:35,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A fully functioning
time-space GPS.</font>

750
00:46:37,537 --> 00:46:38,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want peace.</font>

751
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turns out resentment
is corrosive, and I hate it.</font>

752
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, too.</font>

753
00:46:46,611 --> 00:46:48,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got a shot
at getting these stones,</font>

754
00:46:48,247 --> 00:46:50,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I got to tell you
my priorities.</font>

755
00:46:50,316 --> 00:46:52,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring back what we lost,
I hope, yes.</font>

756
00:46:52,718 --> 00:46:55,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep what I found,
I have to, at all costs.</font>

757
00:46:56,788 --> 00:46:59,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And maybe not die trying.</font>

758
00:46:59,591 --> 00:47:00,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would be nice.</font>

759
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:04,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds like a deal.</font>

760
00:47:27,753 --> 00:47:29,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, I don't know.</font>

761
00:47:29,087 --> 00:47:30,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

762
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He made it for you.</font>

763
00:47:32,691 --> 00:47:34,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plus, honestly,
I have to get it out of the garage</font>

764
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before Morgan takes it sledding.</font>

765
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Tony.</font>

766
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you keep that
a little quiet?</font>

767
00:47:46,104 --> 00:47:47,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't bring one
for the whole team.</font>

768
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:52,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are getting
the whole team, yeah?</font>

769
00:47:52,777 --> 00:47:54,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're working on that right now.</font>

770
00:48:12,663 --> 00:48:14,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Humie.</font>

771
00:48:14,332 --> 00:48:16,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Big Green?</font>

772
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The kitchen, I think.</font>

773
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's awesome.</font>

774
00:48:22,206 --> 00:48:24,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rhodey, careful on re-entry.</font>

775
00:48:24,409 --> 00:48:26,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's an idiot
in the landing zone.</font>

776
00:48:27,311 --> 00:48:28,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God.</font>

777
00:48:28,879 --> 00:48:31,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What's up, Regular-Sized Man?</i></font>

778
00:49:21,798 --> 00:49:24,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kind of a step down
from the golden palaces</font>

779
00:49:24,434 --> 00:49:26,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the magic hammers
and whatnot.</font>

780
00:49:26,136 --> 00:49:27,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, have a little
compassion, pal.</font>

781
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:29,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First, they lost Asgard,
then half their people.</font>

782
00:49:29,873 --> 00:49:31,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're probably just happy
to have a home.</font>

783
00:49:31,641 --> 00:49:33,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shouldn't have come.</font>

784
00:49:33,476 --> 00:49:35,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

785
00:49:35,478 --> 00:49:36,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Valkyrie!</font>

786
00:49:36,613 --> 00:49:39,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great to see you, angry girl!</font>

787
00:49:39,315 --> 00:49:41,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.</font>

788
00:49:42,552 --> 00:49:43,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Rocket.</font>

789
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How ya doing?</font>

790
00:49:47,257 --> 00:49:48,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won't see you.</font>

791
00:49:48,525 --> 00:49:49,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's that bad, huh?</font>

792
00:49:49,691 --> 00:49:51,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We only see him once a month</font>

793
00:49:51,094 --> 00:49:54,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when he comes in for "supplies."</font>

794
00:49:55,465 --> 00:49:56,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's that bad.</font>

795
00:49:56,899 --> 00:49:57,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

796
00:50:10,313 --> 00:50:11,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the...?</font>

797
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:16,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whew! Something died in here!</font>

798
00:50:16,285 --> 00:50:20,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello? Thor!</font>

799
00:50:20,155 --> 00:50:22,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you here about the cable?</font>

800
00:50:22,691 --> 00:50:25,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Cinemax went out
2 weeks ago...</font>

801
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the sports are all
kinda fuzzy and whatnot.</font>

802
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor?</font>

803
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:40,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boys! Oh, my God!</font>

804
00:50:40,943 --> 00:50:43,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God,
it's so good to see you!</font>

805
00:50:45,113 --> 00:50:46,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here, cuddly little rascal.</font>

806
00:50:46,548 --> 00:50:49,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.</font>

807
00:50:49,384 --> 00:50:50,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not necessary.</font>

808
00:50:50,818 --> 00:50:53,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hulk, you know my friends
Miek and Korg, right?</font>

809
00:50:53,689 --> 00:50:54,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, boys!
- Hey, guys.</font>

810
00:50:54,922 --> 00:50:56,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Long time no see.</font>

811
00:50:56,458 --> 00:50:57,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beer's in the bucket.</font>

812
00:50:57,526 --> 00:50:58,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feel free to log on
to the Wi-Fi.</font>

813
00:50:58,826 --> 00:51:00,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No password, obviously.</font>

814
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor, he's back.</font>

815
00:51:03,164 --> 00:51:06,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That kid on the TV just
called me a dickhead again.</font>

816
00:51:06,535 --> 00:51:07,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Noobmaster.</font>

817
00:51:07,703 --> 00:51:10,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, NoobMaster69
called me a dickhead.</font>

818
00:51:10,405 --> 00:51:12,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am sick of this.</font>

819
00:51:12,474 --> 00:51:14,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Noobmaster, hey,
it's Thor again.</font>

820
00:51:14,075 --> 00:51:15,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, the God of Thunder.</font>

821
00:51:15,443 --> 00:51:17,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, bud, if you don't log
off this game immediately...</font>

822
00:51:17,812 --> 00:51:19,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am gonna fly over
to your house,</font>

823
00:51:19,313 --> 00:51:21,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">come down to that basement
you're hiding in...</font>

824
00:51:21,048 --> 00:51:24,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">rip off your arms,
and shove them up your butt!</font>

825
00:51:24,252 --> 00:51:25,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's right, yes!</font>

826
00:51:25,186 --> 00:51:27,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go cry to your father,
you little weasel.</font>

827
00:51:27,855 --> 00:51:28,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Thor.</font>

828
00:51:28,956 --> 00:51:30,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me know if he
bothers you again, okay?</font>

829
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:32,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you very much. I will.</font>

830
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:34,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you guys want a drink?
What are we drinking?</font>

831
00:51:34,128 --> 00:51:37,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.</font>

832
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:41,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buddy.</font>

833
00:51:41,035 --> 00:51:43,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. Why?</font>

834
00:51:43,738 --> 00:51:45,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why, don't I look all right?</font>

835
00:51:45,106 --> 00:51:46,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like melted ice cream.</font>

836
00:51:48,442 --> 00:51:50,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what's up?
You just here for a hang, or what?</font>

837
00:51:50,844 --> 00:51:53,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We need your help.
- Mm.</font>

838
00:51:53,013 --> 00:51:55,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There might be a chance
we could fix everything.</font>

839
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:56,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, like the cable?</font>

840
00:51:56,983 --> 00:51:59,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause that's been
driving me bananas for weeks.</font>

841
00:51:59,487 --> 00:52:00,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like Thanos.</font>

842
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't say that name.</font>

843
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:26,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, yeah, we don't actually
say that name in here.</font>

844
00:52:31,051 --> 00:52:33,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please take your hand off me.</font>

845
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:39,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I know that guy...</font>

846
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">might scare you.</font>

847
00:52:41,695 --> 00:52:43,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would I be...?</font>

848
00:52:43,129 --> 00:52:46,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would I be scared
of that guy?</font>

849
00:52:46,399 --> 00:52:48,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the one who killed
that guy, remember?</font>

850
00:52:48,535 --> 00:52:49,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

851
00:52:49,736 --> 00:52:51,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone else here kill that guy?</font>

852
00:52:55,174 --> 00:52:56,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope.</font>

853
00:52:56,676 --> 00:52:57,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't think so.</font>

854
00:52:58,745 --> 00:53:00,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Korg, why don't you,
uh, tell everybody</font>

855
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who chopped
Thanos' big head off?</font>

856
00:53:03,015 --> 00:53:04,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, Stormbreaker?</font>

857
00:53:04,751 --> 00:53:06,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who was swinging Stormbreaker?</font>

858
00:53:10,322 --> 00:53:12,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get it. You're in
a rough spot, okay?</font>

859
00:53:12,826 --> 00:53:13,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been there myself.</font>

860
00:53:13,959 --> 00:53:16,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you want to know
who helped me out of it?</font>

861
00:53:16,528 --> 00:53:19,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was it Natasha?</font>

862
00:53:19,365 --> 00:53:21,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was you.</font>

863
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You helped me.</font>

864
00:53:24,536 --> 00:53:26,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, why don't you ask...</font>

865
00:53:26,972 --> 00:53:29,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Asgardians down there...</font>

866
00:53:29,575 --> 00:53:31,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how much my help is worth?</font>

867
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:38,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ones that are left, anyway.</font>

868
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:40,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we could
bring them back.</font>

869
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:42,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

870
00:53:43,589 --> 00:53:45,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop, okay?</font>

871
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:46,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you think I'm down here</font>

872
00:53:46,692 --> 00:53:48,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wallowing in my own self-pity...</font>

873
00:53:48,327 --> 00:53:51,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">waiting to be rescued
and saved...</font>

874
00:53:51,095 --> 00:53:53,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'm fine, okay.
We're fine, aren't we?</font>

875
00:53:53,499 --> 00:53:54,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, we're good here, mate.</font>

876
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, whatever it is that you're
offering, we're not into it.</font>

877
00:53:57,101 --> 00:53:58,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't care. Couldn't care less.</font>

878
00:53:58,837 --> 00:54:00,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodbye.</font>

879
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:05,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need you, pal.</font>

880
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:16,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's beer on the ship.</font>

881
00:54:20,558 --> 00:54:22,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind?</font>

882
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:11,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I want you can't give me.</font>

883
00:56:35,257 --> 00:56:36,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shouldn't be here.</font>

884
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neither should you.</font>

885
00:56:46,969 --> 00:56:48,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a job to do.</font>

886
00:56:50,005 --> 00:56:51,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that what
you're calling this?</font>

887
00:56:52,775 --> 00:56:53,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Killing all these people</font>

888
00:56:53,842 --> 00:56:55,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">isn't gonna bring
your family back.</font>

889
00:57:00,983 --> 00:57:02,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We found something.</font>

890
00:57:03,786 --> 00:57:06,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A chance, maybe.</font>

891
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't.</font>

892
00:57:11,492 --> 00:57:12,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't what?</font>

893
00:57:15,897 --> 00:57:17,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't give me hope.</font>

894
00:57:20,535 --> 00:57:23,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry I couldn't
give it to you sooner.</font>

895
00:57:44,759 --> 00:57:46,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're drifting left.</font>

896
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One side there, Lebowski.</font>

897
00:57:51,398 --> 00:57:52,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ratchet, how's it going?</font>

898
00:57:52,967 --> 00:57:54,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Rocket.</font>

899
00:57:54,267 --> 00:57:56,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it easy. You're only
a genius on Earth, pal.</font>

900
00:58:01,475 --> 00:58:03,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time travel suit, not bad.</font>

901
00:58:04,511 --> 00:58:06,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, hey! Easy! Easy!</font>

902
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:07,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm being very careful.</font>

903
00:58:07,314 --> 00:58:08,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you're being very Hulky.</font>

904
00:58:08,916 --> 00:58:10,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm being careful.</font>

905
00:58:10,051 --> 00:58:11,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are Pym Particles,
all right?</font>

906
00:58:11,485 --> 00:58:12,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And ever since
Hank Pym got snapped</font>

907
00:58:12,954 --> 00:58:14,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">out of existence, this is it.</font>

908
00:58:14,221 --> 00:58:16,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what we have.
We're not making any more.</font>

909
00:58:16,156 --> 00:58:18,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Scott, calm down.
- Sorry.</font>

910
00:58:18,358 --> 00:58:21,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got enough for one
round-trip each. That's it.</font>

911
00:58:21,662 --> 00:58:22,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No do-overs.</font>

912
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:25,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plus two test runs.</font>

913
00:58:29,002 --> 00:58:30,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One test run.</font>

914
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:33,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.
I'm not ready for this.</font>

915
00:58:33,073 --> 00:58:34,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm game.</font>

916
00:58:36,677 --> 00:58:38,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll do it.</font>

917
00:58:38,979 --> 00:58:40,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clint, now you're gonna feel</font>

918
00:58:40,179 --> 00:58:41,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a little discombobulated
from the chronoshift.</font>

919
00:58:41,848 --> 00:58:42,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry about that.</font>

920
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:44,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a second.
Let me ask you something.</font>

921
00:58:44,151 --> 00:58:45,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we can do this, you know...</font>

922
00:58:45,786 --> 00:58:48,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">go back in time, why don't
we just find baby Thanos?</font>

923
00:58:48,588 --> 00:58:49,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, and...</font>

924
00:58:53,192 --> 00:58:54,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First of all, that's horrible.</font>

925
00:58:54,861 --> 00:58:55,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Thanos.</font>

926
00:58:55,762 --> 00:58:58,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.</font>

927
00:58:58,131 --> 00:59:00,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Changing the past
doesn't change the future.</font>

928
00:59:00,399 --> 00:59:01,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, we go back,
we get the stones</font>

929
00:59:01,968 --> 00:59:03,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before Thanos gets them...</font>

930
00:59:03,302 --> 00:59:06,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos doesn't have
the stones. Problem solved.</font>

931
00:59:06,238 --> 00:59:08,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bingo.
- That's not how it works.</font>

932
00:59:08,175 --> 00:59:09,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's what I heard.</font>

933
00:59:09,241 --> 00:59:10,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, but who?
Who told you that?</font>

934
00:59:10,476 --> 00:59:12,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Star Trek,
Terminator, Timecop...</i></font>

935
00:59:12,445 --> 00:59:14,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Time After Time.
- Quantum Leap.</i></font>

936
00:59:14,246 --> 00:59:15,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wrinkle in Time,
Somewhere in Time.</i></font>

937
00:59:15,347 --> 00:59:17,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hot Tub Time Machine.</i></font>

938
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:18,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Bill and Ted's
Excellent Adventure.</i></font>

939
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:21,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Basically, any movie
that deals with time travel.</font>

940
00:59:21,253 --> 00:59:23,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Die Hard.</i> No, that's not one.</font>

941
00:59:23,255 --> 00:59:24,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is known.</font>

942
00:59:24,423 --> 00:59:25,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know why
everyone believes that,</font>

943
00:59:25,858 --> 00:59:26,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that isn't true.</font>

944
00:59:26,792 --> 00:59:29,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think about it.
If you travel to the past...</font>

945
00:59:29,095 --> 00:59:31,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that past becomes your future...</font>

946
00:59:31,497 --> 00:59:34,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and your former present
becomes the past...</font>

947
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which can't now be changed
by your new future.</font>

948
00:59:37,636 --> 00:59:39,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly.</font>

949
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:42,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So <i>Back to the Future</i>
is a bunch of bullshit?</font>

950
00:59:46,112 --> 00:59:48,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Clint.</font>

951
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:52,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going in 3, 2...
1.</font>

952
01:01:04,855 --> 01:01:06,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cooper?</font>

953
01:01:06,257 --> 01:01:07,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are my headphones?</font>

954
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:09,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lila?</font>

955
01:01:09,092 --> 01:01:11,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I never had them.
- Lila?</font>

956
01:01:12,263 --> 01:01:13,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you had them yesterday!</font>

957
01:01:14,431 --> 01:01:15,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lila! Lila!</font>

958
01:01:21,271 --> 01:01:22,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Dad?</font>

959
01:01:26,176 --> 01:01:27,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

960
01:01:29,813 --> 01:01:31,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lila!</font>

961
01:01:36,987 --> 01:01:39,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Hey, look at me.</font>

962
01:01:39,388 --> 01:01:41,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

963
01:01:41,258 --> 01:01:43,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

964
01:01:45,229 --> 01:01:46,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It worked.</font>

965
01:01:48,165 --> 01:01:49,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It worked.</font>

966
01:01:52,568 --> 01:01:54,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so the how works.</font>

967
01:01:54,972 --> 01:01:58,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, we got to figure out
the when and the where.</font>

968
01:01:58,875 --> 01:02:00,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter...</font>

969
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:02,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with at least one
of the 6 Infinity Stones.</font>

970
01:02:02,712 --> 01:02:04,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or substitute
the word "encounter"...</font>

971
01:02:04,447 --> 01:02:05,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for "damn near been killed"</font>

972
01:02:05,581 --> 01:02:07,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by one of the 6
Infinity Stones.</font>

973
01:02:07,251 --> 01:02:09,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I haven't...
but I don't even know</font>

974
01:02:09,585 --> 01:02:10,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what the hell
you're all talking about.</font>

975
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:14,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Regardless, we only have
enough Pym Particles</font>

976
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:16,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for one round-trip each.</font>

977
01:02:16,058 --> 01:02:17,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And these stones have been</font>

978
01:02:17,093 --> 01:02:19,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a lot of different places
throughout history.</font>

979
01:02:19,362 --> 01:02:20,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our history.</font>

980
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:23,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?</font>

981
01:02:23,866 --> 01:02:25,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which means we have
to pick our targets.</font>

982
01:02:26,269 --> 01:02:27,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Correct.</font>

983
01:02:28,771 --> 01:02:30,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, let's start with the Aether.</font>

984
01:02:30,572 --> 01:02:31,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor, what do you know?</font>

985
01:02:37,412 --> 01:02:38,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he asleep?</font>

986
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.</font>

987
01:02:44,419 --> 01:02:46,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, where to start? Um...</font>

988
01:02:47,689 --> 01:02:50,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.</font>

989
01:02:50,692 --> 01:02:53,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone called it
a stone before.</font>

990
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:58,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...</font>

991
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so someone's gonna need
to amend that</font>

992
01:02:59,968 --> 01:03:01,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and stop saying that.</font>

993
01:03:01,469 --> 01:03:04,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.</font>

994
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My grandfather,
many years ago...</font>

995
01:03:06,275 --> 01:03:10,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.</font>

996
01:03:10,379 --> 01:03:12,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh. Scary beings.</font>

997
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Jane, actually...</font>

998
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, there she is.</font>

999
01:03:16,952 --> 01:03:21,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.</font>

1000
01:03:21,389 --> 01:03:24,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...</font>

1001
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:28,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...</font>

1002
01:03:28,163 --> 01:03:29,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she became very, very sick.</font>

1003
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:32,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And so I had to
take her to Asgard,</font>

1004
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is where I'm from...</font>

1005
01:03:33,368 --> 01:03:35,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we had to try and fix her.</font>

1006
01:03:35,469 --> 01:03:37,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were dating at the time,
you see...</font>

1007
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:40,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I got to introduce her
to my mother...</font>

1008
01:03:41,876 --> 01:03:44,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who's dead and, um...</font>

1009
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:46,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you know, Jane and I</font>

1010
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">aren't even
dating anymore, so...</font>

1011
01:03:50,051 --> 01:03:51,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?</font>

1012
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:52,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...</font>

1013
01:03:52,753 --> 01:03:54,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why don't you come sit down?
- I'm not done yet.</font>

1014
01:03:54,755 --> 01:03:56,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only thing
that is permanent in life</font>

1015
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:57,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is impermanence.</font>

1016
01:03:58,592 --> 01:04:01,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?</font>

1017
01:04:01,161 --> 01:04:03,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.</font>

1018
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:06,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quill said he stole
the Power Stone from Morag.</font>

1019
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:09,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that a person?
- No, Morag's a planet.</font>

1020
01:04:10,037 --> 01:04:11,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quill was a person.</font>

1021
01:04:11,939 --> 01:04:14,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a planet?
Like in outer space?</font>

1022
01:04:14,541 --> 01:04:15,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, look.</font>

1023
01:04:15,943 --> 01:04:18,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.</font>

1024
01:04:18,846 --> 01:04:22,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you wanna go to space?
You wanna go to space, puppy?</font>

1025
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:23,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take you to space.</font>

1026
01:04:24,718 --> 01:04:26,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos found
the Soul Stone on Vormir.</font>

1027
01:04:26,987 --> 01:04:28,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is Vormir?</font>

1028
01:04:28,889 --> 01:04:30,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A dominion of death...</font>

1029
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:32,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at the very center
of celestial existence.</font>

1030
01:04:34,627 --> 01:04:38,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's where Thanos
murdered my sister.</font>

1031
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:46,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not it.</font>

1032
01:04:47,874 --> 01:04:49,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That Time Stone guy.
- Doctor Strange.</font>

1033
01:04:49,642 --> 01:04:51,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, what kind
of doctor was he?</font>

1034
01:04:51,611 --> 01:04:53,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ear-nose-throat
meets rabbit-from-hat.</font>

1035
01:04:53,746 --> 01:04:55,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice place
in the Village, though.</font>

1036
01:04:55,282 --> 01:04:56,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, on Sullivan Street?</font>

1037
01:04:56,883 --> 01:04:58,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm... Bleecker Street.</font>

1038
01:04:58,217 --> 01:04:59,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, he lived in New York?</font>

1039
01:04:59,752 --> 01:05:00,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he lived in Toronto.</font>

1040
01:05:00,853 --> 01:05:01,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, yeah, on Bleecker
and Sullivan.</font>

1041
01:05:01,954 --> 01:05:03,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you been listening
to anything?</font>

1042
01:05:03,222 --> 01:05:04,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys.</font>

1043
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:05,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you pick the right year,</font>

1044
01:05:05,892 --> 01:05:07,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there are 3 stones
in New York.</font>

1045
01:05:10,163 --> 01:05:11,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut the front door.</font>

1046
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:16,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. We have a plan.</font>

1047
01:05:16,769 --> 01:05:21,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6 stones, 3 teams,
1 shot.</font>

1048
01:05:31,017 --> 01:05:33,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>5 years ago, we lost.</i></font>

1049
01:05:34,387 --> 01:05:35,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All of us.</i></font>

1050
01:05:37,557 --> 01:05:39,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We lost friends.</i></font>

1051
01:05:39,624 --> 01:05:41,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We lost family.</i></font>

1052
01:05:43,329 --> 01:05:45,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We lost a part of ourselves.</i></font>

1053
01:05:46,365 --> 01:05:49,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.</i></font>

1054
01:05:50,169 --> 01:05:53,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You know your teams.
You know your missions.</i></font>

1055
01:05:53,905 --> 01:05:56,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Get the stones. Get them back.</i></font>

1056
01:05:56,708 --> 01:05:58,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One round-trip each.</font>

1057
01:05:58,176 --> 01:05:59,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No mistakes...</font>

1058
01:05:59,678 --> 01:06:01,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no do-overs.</font>

1059
01:06:01,547 --> 01:06:03,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most of us are going
somewhere we know.</font>

1060
01:06:03,381 --> 01:06:05,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That doesn't mean
we should know what to expect.</font>

1061
01:06:06,586 --> 01:06:07,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be careful.</font>

1062
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look out for each other.</font>

1063
01:06:10,889 --> 01:06:12,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the fight
of our lives...</font>

1064
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:15,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we're gonna win.</font>

1065
01:06:17,429 --> 01:06:18,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever it takes.</font>

1066
01:06:21,632 --> 01:06:23,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck.</font>

1067
01:06:23,335 --> 01:06:24,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's pretty good at that.</font>

1068
01:06:24,536 --> 01:06:25,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right?
- All right.</font>

1069
01:06:25,804 --> 01:06:26,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You heard the man.</font>

1070
01:06:26,872 --> 01:06:28,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.</font>

1071
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:31,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trackers engaged.</font>

1072
01:06:31,309 --> 01:06:33,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You promise to bring that
back in one piece, right?</font>

1073
01:06:33,512 --> 01:06:35,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>

1074
01:06:35,113 --> 01:06:36,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I'll do my best.</font>

1075
01:06:36,947 --> 01:06:38,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As promises go,
that was pretty lame.</font>

1076
01:06:41,486 --> 01:06:43,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See ya in a minute.</font>

1077
01:07:37,508 --> 01:07:38,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, we all have
our assignments.</font>

1078
01:07:38,875 --> 01:07:41,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 stones uptown,
1 stone down.</font>

1079
01:07:41,212 --> 01:07:43,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay low. Keep an eye
on the clock.</font>

1080
01:07:58,696 --> 01:08:00,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe smash a few things
along the way.</font>

1081
01:08:01,632 --> 01:08:03,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.</font>

1082
01:08:31,227 --> 01:08:32,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd be careful going that way.</font>

1083
01:08:32,861 --> 01:08:34,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just had the floors waxed.</font>

1084
01:08:39,835 --> 01:08:41,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm looking
for Doctor Strange.</font>

1085
01:08:43,005 --> 01:08:46,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're about
5 years too early.</font>

1086
01:08:46,743 --> 01:08:48,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stephen Strange is currently
performing surgery</font>

1087
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:50,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about 20 blocks that way.</font>

1088
01:08:52,347 --> 01:08:53,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want from him?</font>

1089
01:08:54,283 --> 01:08:55,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That, actually.</font>

1090
01:08:56,251 --> 01:08:57,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

1091
01:08:58,453 --> 01:08:59,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm afraid not.</font>

1092
01:08:59,788 --> 01:09:01,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, but I wasn't asking.</font>

1093
01:09:02,024 --> 01:09:03,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want to do this.</font>

1094
01:09:03,325 --> 01:09:04,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, you're right, I don't.
But I need that stone...</font>

1095
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I don't have time
to debate it.</font>

1096
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:17,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's start over, shall we?</font>

1097
01:09:28,684 --> 01:09:30,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For you, Lady Jane.</font>

1098
01:09:30,218 --> 01:09:32,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, so you have
anything with pants?</font>

1099
01:09:32,853 --> 01:09:34,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pants?</font>

1100
01:09:34,189 --> 01:09:36,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never mind.
These will be fine. Thank you.</font>

1101
01:09:36,224 --> 01:09:38,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, milady.
- Oh, there's Jane.</font>

1102
01:09:39,628 --> 01:09:40,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1103
01:09:42,096 --> 01:09:43,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's the deal, tubby.</font>

1104
01:09:43,632 --> 01:09:44,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna charm her,</font>

1105
01:09:44,766 --> 01:09:46,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm gonna poke her
with this thing...</font>

1106
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and extract the Reality Stone,
and get gone lickety-split.</font>

1107
01:09:50,438 --> 01:09:51,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be right back, okay?</font>

1108
01:09:51,606 --> 01:09:53,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The wine cellar
is just down here.</font>

1109
01:09:53,341 --> 01:09:56,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father used to have this
huge barrel of Aakonian ale.</font>

1110
01:09:56,377 --> 01:09:57,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see if the scullery
has a couple of to-go cups.</font>

1111
01:09:57,945 --> 01:09:59,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Hey! Aren't you
drunk enough already?</font>

1112
01:10:07,121 --> 01:10:08,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you could send Loki
some soup.</font>

1113
01:10:08,389 --> 01:10:09,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, milady.</font>

1114
01:10:09,457 --> 01:10:10,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And ask our librarians</font>

1115
01:10:10,491 --> 01:10:13,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to pull some volumes
from the astronomy shelf.</font>

1116
01:10:19,533 --> 01:10:21,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's the fancy broad?</font>

1117
01:10:22,436 --> 01:10:24,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my mother.</font>

1118
01:10:24,438 --> 01:10:26,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She dies today.</font>

1119
01:10:26,741 --> 01:10:28,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that is today?</font>

1120
01:10:35,014 --> 01:10:38,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't do this.
I can't do this.</font>

1121
01:10:38,118 --> 01:10:39,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have come.</font>

1122
01:10:39,886 --> 01:10:41,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a bad idea!</font>

1123
01:10:41,221 --> 01:10:42,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come here.
- No, no, no.</font>

1124
01:10:42,389 --> 01:10:44,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'm having
a panic attack.</font>

1125
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here. Right here.</font>

1126
01:10:46,059 --> 01:10:47,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shouldn't be here.
This is bad.</font>

1127
01:10:47,894 --> 01:10:49,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you're the
only one who lost people?</font>

1128
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:51,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think
we're doing here?</font>

1129
01:10:51,732 --> 01:10:53,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lost the only family
I ever had.</font>

1130
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quill, Groot, Drax,
the chick with the antenna...</font>

1131
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all gone.</font>

1132
01:10:58,773 --> 01:11:01,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get you miss your mom...
but she's gone.</font>

1133
01:11:01,776 --> 01:11:03,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really gone.</font>

1134
01:11:03,243 --> 01:11:06,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there are plenty of people
who are only kind of gone...</font>

1135
01:11:06,446 --> 01:11:07,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you can help them.</font>

1136
01:11:08,648 --> 01:11:10,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, is it too much to ask</font>

1137
01:11:10,116 --> 01:11:11,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you brush the crumbs
out of your beard...</font>

1138
01:11:11,951 --> 01:11:14,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">make schmoopy talk
to Pretty Pants...</font>

1139
01:11:14,554 --> 01:11:17,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and when she's not looking,
suck out the Infinity Stone...</font>

1140
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:19,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and help me get my family back?</font>

1141
01:11:20,627 --> 01:11:22,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1142
01:11:22,429 --> 01:11:23,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you crying?</font>

1143
01:11:23,929 --> 01:11:25,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1144
01:11:27,233 --> 01:11:28,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1145
01:11:28,301 --> 01:11:29,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like I'm losing it.</font>

1146
01:11:29,803 --> 01:11:30,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get it together!</font>

1147
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:31,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can do this.</font>

1148
01:11:33,005 --> 01:11:34,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can do this.</font>

1149
01:11:37,677 --> 01:11:38,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right?</font>

1150
01:11:38,812 --> 01:11:39,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I can.</font>

1151
01:11:39,945 --> 01:11:41,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

1152
01:11:43,115 --> 01:11:45,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can do this. I can do this.</font>

1153
01:11:46,452 --> 01:11:47,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't do this.</font>

1154
01:11:47,953 --> 01:11:49,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, heartbreaker,
she's alone.</font>

1155
01:11:49,923 --> 01:11:51,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is our shot.</font>

1156
01:11:51,623 --> 01:11:54,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor? Thor!</font>

1157
01:12:04,336 --> 01:12:05,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, bring it down, Blue.</font>

1158
01:12:05,939 --> 01:12:08,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right on that line.
That's it. Down, down.</font>

1159
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:14,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, can we hurry it up?</font>

1160
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.</font>

1161
01:12:17,081 --> 01:12:19,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All that is really helpful.</font>

1162
01:12:21,052 --> 01:12:22,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Take care, okay?
- Yeah.</font>

1163
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:25,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get that stone and come back.
No messing around.</font>

1164
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:27,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey.
- We got this.</font>

1165
01:12:27,459 --> 01:12:28,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's get it done.
- Yes, sir.</font>

1166
01:12:28,961 --> 01:12:30,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you back.</font>

1167
01:12:30,963 --> 01:12:32,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys watch each other's 6.</font>

1168
01:12:32,965 --> 01:12:34,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1169
01:12:42,908 --> 01:12:44,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coordinates
for Vormir are laid in.</font>

1170
01:12:46,043 --> 01:12:48,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All they have to do
is not fall out.</font>

1171
01:12:53,919 --> 01:12:56,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're a long way from Budapest.</font>

1172
01:13:01,125 --> 01:13:03,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so, uh...</font>

1173
01:13:03,728 --> 01:13:07,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...</font>

1174
01:13:07,231 --> 01:13:09,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then he leads us to the Power
Stone, is that it?</font>

1175
01:13:10,101 --> 01:13:11,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's take cover.</font>

1176
01:13:12,937 --> 01:13:15,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.</font>

1177
01:13:15,573 --> 01:13:17,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute.
What are you talking about right now?</font>

1178
01:13:17,173 --> 01:13:18,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who else is looking
for these stones?</font>

1179
01:13:22,145 --> 01:13:27,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father...
my sister... and me.</font>

1180
01:13:27,018 --> 01:13:28,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you?</font>

1181
01:13:30,053 --> 01:13:31,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you right now?</font>

1182
01:14:00,283 --> 01:14:01,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome.</font>

1183
01:14:01,751 --> 01:14:04,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't ask for your help.</font>

1184
01:14:04,721 --> 01:14:06,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yet, you always need it.</font>

1185
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get up. Father wants us
back on the ship.</font>

1186
01:14:12,596 --> 01:14:13,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

1187
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:15,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's found an Infinity Stone.</font>

1188
01:14:20,135 --> 01:14:21,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where?</font>

1189
01:14:21,671 --> 01:14:23,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On a planet called Morag.</font>

1190
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:27,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father's plan
is finally in motion.</font>

1191
01:14:27,209 --> 01:14:29,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One stone isn't 6, Nebula.</font>

1192
01:14:29,546 --> 01:14:30,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a start.</font>

1193
01:14:30,847 --> 01:14:32,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he gets all of them...</font>

1194
01:14:45,494 --> 01:14:47,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ronan's located the Power Stone.</font>

1195
01:14:47,363 --> 01:14:49,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm dispatching you to his ship.</font>

1196
01:14:49,264 --> 01:14:50,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won't like that.</font>

1197
01:14:50,766 --> 01:14:52,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His alternative is death.</font>

1198
01:14:54,303 --> 01:14:56,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ronan's obsession...</font>

1199
01:14:57,107 --> 01:14:59,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">clouds his judgment.</font>

1200
01:15:03,779 --> 01:15:05,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will not fail you, Father.</font>

1201
01:15:06,649 --> 01:15:08,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you won't.</font>

1202
01:15:10,919 --> 01:15:11,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear...</font>

1203
01:15:13,822 --> 01:15:15,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will make you proud.</font>

1204
01:15:23,866 --> 01:15:27,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...</i></font>

1205
01:15:27,736 --> 01:15:30,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and then he leads us to the
Power Stone, is that it?</i></font>

1206
01:15:30,072 --> 01:15:32,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Let's take cover.</i></font>

1207
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:34,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We're not the only ones in 2014</i></font>

1208
01:15:34,442 --> 01:15:35,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>looking for the stones.</i></font>

1209
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who was that?</font>

1210
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:40,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

1211
01:15:40,615 --> 01:15:42,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My head is splitting.
I don't know.</font>

1212
01:15:44,318 --> 01:15:47,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.</font>

1213
01:15:48,023 --> 01:15:49,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh.</font>

1214
01:15:57,699 --> 01:15:59,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring her to my ship.</font>

1215
01:16:07,108 --> 01:16:08,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better hustle, Cap.</font>

1216
01:16:08,443 --> 01:16:10,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Things look like they're
just about wrapped up here.</font>

1217
01:16:10,178 --> 01:16:12,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Got it.
I'm approaching the elevator now.</i></font>

1218
01:16:18,519 --> 01:16:20,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it's all the same to you...</font>

1219
01:16:22,422 --> 01:16:24,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll have that drink now.</font>

1220
01:16:24,491 --> 01:16:26,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, get him on his feet.</font>

1355
01:23:43,122 --> 01:23:45,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry,
I can't help you, Bruce.</font>

1356
01:23:46,058 --> 01:23:47,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I give up the Time Stone</font>

1357
01:23:47,594 --> 01:23:49,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to help your reality,
I'm dooming my own.</font>

1358
01:23:49,495 --> 01:23:51,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With all due respect,
all right...</font>

1359
01:23:51,230 --> 01:23:54,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure the science
really supports that.</font>

1360
01:24:00,206 --> 01:24:02,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Infinity Stones create</font>

1361
01:24:02,041 --> 01:24:04,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what you experience
as the flow of time.</font>

1362
01:24:04,577 --> 01:24:06,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remove one of the stones...</font>

1363
01:24:06,345 --> 01:24:08,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that flow splits.</font>

1364
01:24:08,548 --> 01:24:11,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this may benefit
your reality...</font>

1365
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:13,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but my new one, not so much.</font>

1366
01:24:13,653 --> 01:24:15,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In this new branch reality...</font>

1367
01:24:15,555 --> 01:24:17,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without our chief weapon</font>

1368
01:24:17,356 --> 01:24:18,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">against the forces
of darkness...</font>

1369
01:24:18,957 --> 01:24:21,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">our world would be overrun.</font>

1370
01:24:21,227 --> 01:24:23,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Millions will suffer.</font>

1371
01:24:23,128 --> 01:24:24,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, tell me, Doctor.</font>

1372
01:24:24,796 --> 01:24:27,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can your science
prevent all that?</font>

1373
01:24:27,266 --> 01:24:28,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No...</font>

1374
01:24:29,268 --> 01:24:30,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we can erase it.</font>

1375
01:24:30,303 --> 01:24:32,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because once we're done
with the stones...</font>

1376
01:24:32,204 --> 01:24:34,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we can return each one
to its own timeline...</font>

1377
01:24:34,674 --> 01:24:36,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at the moment it was taken.</font>

1378
01:24:36,409 --> 01:24:38,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, chronologically...</font>

1379
01:24:39,811 --> 01:24:41,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in that reality...</font>

1380
01:24:43,515 --> 01:24:45,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it never left.</font>

1381
01:24:47,352 --> 01:24:50,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.</font>

1382
01:24:54,092 --> 01:24:56,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In order to return the stones,
you have to survive.</font>

1383
01:24:56,795 --> 01:25:00,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will. I will. I promise.</font>

1384
01:25:00,131 --> 01:25:02,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't risk this reality
on a promise.</font>

1385
01:25:03,902 --> 01:25:06,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the duty
of the Sorcerer Supreme</font>

1386
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:08,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to protect the Time Stone.</font>

1387
01:25:08,906 --> 01:25:11,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then why the hell
did Strange give it away?</font>

1388
01:25:12,776 --> 01:25:13,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you say?</font>

1389
01:25:13,978 --> 01:25:16,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to Thanos.</font>

1390
01:25:16,947 --> 01:25:18,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Willingly?
- Yes.</font>

1391
01:25:22,554 --> 01:25:24,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why?
- I have no idea.</font>

1392
01:25:24,356 --> 01:25:26,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe he made a mistake.</font>

1393
01:25:36,267 --> 01:25:37,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or I did.</font>

1394
01:25:57,721 --> 01:26:00,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strange is meant to be
the best of us.</font>

1395
01:26:00,190 --> 01:26:02,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, he must've done it
for a reason.</font>

1396
01:26:03,627 --> 01:26:05,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fear you might be right.</font>

1397
01:26:10,467 --> 01:26:11,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1398
01:26:17,675 --> 01:26:19,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm counting on you, Bruce.</font>

1399
01:26:21,445 --> 01:26:22,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all are.</font>

1400
01:26:42,999 --> 01:26:44,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run diagnostics.</font>

1401
01:26:45,435 --> 01:26:47,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show me her memory file.</font>

1402
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:51,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sire, the file
appears entangled.</font>

1403
01:26:52,575 --> 01:26:54,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a memory, but not hers.</font>

1404
01:26:55,745 --> 01:26:57,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's another consciousness...</font>

1405
01:26:57,413 --> 01:26:58,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sharing her network.</font>

1406
01:26:59,282 --> 01:27:00,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Another Nebula.</font>

1407
01:27:02,652 --> 01:27:04,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Impossible.</font>

1408
01:27:04,153 --> 01:27:07,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This duplicate
carries a time stamp...</font>

1409
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:10,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from 9 years in the future.</font>

1410
01:27:14,597 --> 01:27:17,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is this other Nebula?</font>

1411
01:27:17,734 --> 01:27:19,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In our solar system on Morag.</font>

1412
01:27:21,371 --> 01:27:22,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you access her?</font>

1413
01:27:22,739 --> 01:27:24,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, the two are linked.</font>

1414
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:27,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Search the duplicate's
memories...</font>

1415
01:27:27,109 --> 01:27:29,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for Infinity Stones.</font>

1416
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:34,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And these stones have been</i></font>

1417
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>in a lot of different places
throughout history.</i></font>

1418
01:27:36,017 --> 01:27:37,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Our history.</i></font>

1419
01:27:37,152 --> 01:27:39,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So, not a lot
of convenient spots</i></font>

1420
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:40,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>to just drop in.</i></font>

1421
01:27:40,723 --> 01:27:42,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Which means
we have to pick our targets.</i></font>

1422
01:27:42,491 --> 01:27:44,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Correct.</i>
- Freeze image.</font>

1423
01:27:45,894 --> 01:27:47,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Terrans.</font>

1424
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:50,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Avengers.</font>

1425

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unruly wretches.</font>

1426
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:54,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that reflection?</font>

1427
01:27:55,936 --> 01:27:57,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amplify this, Maw.</font>

1428
01:28:00,675 --> 01:28:02,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand.</font>

1429
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two Nebulas.</font>

1430
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:10,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. The same Nebula...</font>

1431
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:13,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from two different times.</font>

1432
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:16,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Set course for Morag.</font>

1433
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:18,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And scan
the duplicate's memories.</font>

1434
01:28:19,561 --> 01:28:22,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna see everything.</font>

1435
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:33,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My ladies, I'll see you after.</font>

1436
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:35,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you after. Go on ahead.</font>

1437
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:50,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

1438
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:53,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God!</font>

1439
01:28:53,461 --> 01:28:56,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're better off leaving
the sneaking to your brother.</font>

1440
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:58,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I wasn't sneaking.
I was just going for a walk.</font>

1441
01:28:58,165 --> 01:28:59,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you wearing?</font>

1442
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:02,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always wear this.
It's one of my favorites.</font>

1443
01:29:05,038 --> 01:29:07,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm...
What's wrong with your eye?</font>

1444
01:29:07,775 --> 01:29:08,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my eye.</font>

1445
01:29:08,909 --> 01:29:11,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember the, uh,
Battle of Harokin...</font>

1446
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:12,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I got hit in the face</font>

1447
01:29:12,278 --> 01:29:14,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the broadsword?</font>

1448
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:19,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not the Thor
I know at all, are you?</font>

1449
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:22,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I am.</font>

1450
01:29:22,522 --> 01:29:25,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The future hasn't been kind
to you, has it?</font>

1451
01:29:25,492 --> 01:29:27,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't say
I was from the future.</font>

1452
01:29:27,994 --> 01:29:31,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was raised by witches, boy.</font>

1453
01:29:31,464 --> 01:29:34,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see with more than eyes,
you know that.</font>

1454
01:29:36,035 --> 01:29:38,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah,
I'm totally from the future.</font>

1455
01:29:38,571 --> 01:29:40,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you are, honey.</font>

1456
01:29:40,206 --> 01:29:41,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really need to talk to you.</font>

1457
01:29:41,942 --> 01:29:43,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can talk.</font>

1458
01:30:07,065 --> 01:30:09,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His head was over there...</font>

1459
01:30:09,736 --> 01:30:13,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and his body over there...</font>

1460
01:30:13,138 --> 01:30:16,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, what was
the point? I was too late.</font>

1461
01:30:16,709 --> 01:30:18,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just standing there.</font>

1462
01:30:19,177 --> 01:30:21,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some idiot with an axe.</font>

1463
01:30:21,113 --> 01:30:23,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you're no idiot.</font>

1464
01:30:23,983 --> 01:30:25,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're here, aren't you?</font>

1465
01:30:25,617 --> 01:30:28,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seeking counsel from
the wisest person in Asgard.</font>

1466
01:30:28,654 --> 01:30:29,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am. Yes.</font>

1467
01:30:29,822 --> 01:30:31,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Idiot, no.</font>

1468
01:30:31,423 --> 01:30:32,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A failure?</font>

1469
01:30:32,959 --> 01:30:34,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely.</font>

1470
01:30:34,192 --> 01:30:36,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a little bit harsh.</font>

1471
01:30:36,161 --> 01:30:37,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what that makes you?</font>

1472
01:30:38,932 --> 01:30:41,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like everyone else.</font>

1473
01:30:41,066 --> 01:30:43,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?</font>

1474
01:30:43,402 --> 01:30:44,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm.</font>

1475
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:48,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone fails at who
they're supposed to be, Thor.</font>

1476
01:30:48,273 --> 01:30:51,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The measure of a person,
of a hero...</font>

1477
01:30:51,443 --> 01:30:55,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is how well they succeed
at being who they are.</font>

1478
01:31:00,151 --> 01:31:01,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've really missed you, Mom.</font>

1479
01:31:07,626 --> 01:31:09,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor! I got it!</font>

1480
01:31:10,127 --> 01:31:11,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get that rabbit!</font>

1481
01:31:14,566 --> 01:31:16,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, I have to
tell you something.</font>

1482
01:31:16,567 --> 01:31:18,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, son, you don't.</font>

1483
01:31:18,336 --> 01:31:21,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're here to repair
your future, not mine.</font>

1484
01:31:21,073 --> 01:31:22,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is about your future.</font>

1485
01:31:22,874 --> 01:31:24,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, it's none of my business.</font>

1486
01:31:28,412 --> 01:31:29,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

1487
01:31:29,747 --> 01:31:31,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must be Mom.</font>

1488
01:31:31,682 --> 01:31:33,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got the thing.
Come on. We got to move.</font>

1490
01:31:35,087 --> 01:31:37,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, this was a gift.</font>

1491
01:31:37,089 --> 01:31:40,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you go and be the man
you're meant to be.</font>

1492
01:31:40,992 --> 01:31:42,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, Mom.</font>

1493
01:31:42,126 --> 01:31:43,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>

1494
01:31:47,698 --> 01:31:49,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And eat a salad.</font>

1495
01:31:50,635 --> 01:31:51,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, we got to go.</font>

1496
01:31:51,869 --> 01:31:53,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Goodbye.
- 3...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 2...
- No, wait!</font>

1498
01:31:57,942 --> 01:31:59,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I looking at?</font>

1499
01:31:59,242 --> 01:32:00,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, sometimes it takes a second.</font>

1500
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:12,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm still worthy.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, boy.</font>

1502
01:32:16,393 --> 01:32:18,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Goodbye, Mom.
- Goodbye.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, he's an idiot?</font>

1504
01:33:00,704 --> 01:33:02,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1505
01:33:10,647 --> 01:33:11,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

1506
01:33:11,948 --> 01:33:13,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The tool of a thief.</font>

1507
01:33:21,523 --> 01:33:23,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa, whoa.</font>

1508
01:33:23,459 --> 01:33:25,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the part
where spikes come out...</font>

1509

<font face="Comic Sans MS">with skeletons on the end
of them and everything.</font>

1510

<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you break into
a place called.</font>

a bunch of booby traps.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God.
- Okay. All right. Go ahead.</font>

1515
01:34:07,870 --> 01:34:09,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wasn't always like this.</font>

1516
01:34:10,205 --> 01:34:11,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me either.</font>

1517
01:34:13,041 --> 01:34:14,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we work
with what we got, right?</font>

1518
01:34:16,178 --> 01:34:17,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

1519
01:34:18,213 --> 01:34:19,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's sync up.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you do to them?</font>

1533
01:35:06,359 --> 01:35:07,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>

1534
01:35:08,662 --> 01:35:09,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yet.</font>

1535

01:35:17,637 --> 01:35:19,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've already done in theirs.</font>

1539
01:35:19,406 --> 01:35:21,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The stones.</font>

1540
01:35:22,076 --> 01:35:24,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found them all.</font>

1541
01:35:25,846 --> 01:35:27,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

1558

<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you'll have the chance
to prove it.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what are we gonna do now?</font>

1571
01:37:13,551 --> 01:37:14,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?
Give me a break, Steve.</font>

1572
01:37:14,619 --> 01:37:15,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just got hit in the head
with the Hulk.</font>

1573

<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was our shot.</font>

1575
01:37:19,158 --> 01:37:21,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We shot it. It's shot.
6 stones or nothing.</font>

01:37:26,064 --> 01:37:26,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude. Come on!</font>

1580
01:37:26,931 --> 01:37:28,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You never wanted
a time heist.</font>

1581
01:37:28,066 --> 01:37:29,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You weren't on board
with the time heist.</font>

1582
01:37:29,567 --> 01:37:30,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I dropped the ball.
- You ruined the time heist.</font>

1583
01:37:30,635 --> 01:37:31,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that what I did?
- Yeah.</font>

1584
01:37:31,869 --> 01:37:33,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?</font>

1585
01:37:33,838 --> 01:37:35,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, there's
no other options.</font>

1586
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:36,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no do-overs.</font>

1587
01:37:36,741 --> 01:37:38,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not going anywhere else.
We have one particle left.</font>

1588
01:37:38,977 --> 01:37:39,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Each.</font>

1589
01:37:39,877 --> 01:37:42,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it. All right?
We use that...</font>

1590
01:37:42,447 --> 01:37:43,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">bye-bye, you're not going home.</font>

1591
01:37:43,748 --> 01:37:45,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, if we don't try...</font>

1592
01:37:45,817 --> 01:37:47,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then no one else
is going home, either.</font>

1593
01:37:47,285 --> 01:37:48,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it.</font>

1594
01:37:49,454 --> 01:37:51,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's another way
to retake the Tesseract</font>

1595
01:37:51,723 --> 01:37:54,357

<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were there at a time...
I have a vaguely exact idea.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How vague?
- What are you talking about?</font>

1602
01:38:08,772 --> 01:38:09,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know for a fact
they were there.</font>

1604
01:38:11,075 --> 01:38:12,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I know how I know.</font>

1605
01:38:14,077 --> 01:38:16,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, what is it?</font>

1606
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:17,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like we're improvising.</font>

1607
01:38:17,848 --> 01:38:19,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Great.
- What are we improvising?</font>

1608

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott, get this back
to the compound.</font>

1609

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>

1625
01:39:06,962 --> 01:39:10,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, man! Make love, not war.</font>

1626
01:39:16,605 --> 01:39:19,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clearly you weren't
actually born here, right?</font>

1627
01:39:19,476 --> 01:39:22,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The idea of me was.</font>

1628
01:39:22,011 --> 01:39:23,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Well,
imagine you're S.H.I.E.I.D...</font>

1629
01:39:23,813 --> 01:39:27,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization...</font>

1630
01:39:28,452 --> 01:39:30,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where do you hide it?</font>

1631
01:39:30,252 --> 01:39:31,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In plain sight.</font>

1632
01:40:00,116 --> 01:40:01,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck
on your mission, Captain.</font>

1633
01:40:01,550 --> 01:40:04,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck
on your project, Doctor.</font>

1634
01:40:07,523 --> 01:40:08,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You new here?</font>

1635
01:40:11,227 --> 01:40:12,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not exactly.</font>

1636
01:40:19,267 --> 01:40:21,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, you bastard.</font>

1637
01:40:27,942 --> 01:40:29,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotcha.</font>

1638
01:40:34,249 --> 01:40:35,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whew.</font>

1639
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:48,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back in the game.</font>

1640
01:40:51,232 --> 01:40:52,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arnim, you in there?</font>

1641
01:40:53,368 --> 01:40:54,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arnim?</font>

1642
01:40:59,641 --> 01:41:01,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1643
01:41:01,643 --> 01:41:03,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The door is this way, pal.</font>

1644
01:41:04,279 --> 01:41:05,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font>

1645
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looking for Doctor Zola,
have you seen him?</font>

1646
01:41:07,282 --> 01:41:11,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Doctor Zola.
No, I haven't seen a soul.</font>

1647
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:13,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pardon me.</font>

1648
01:41:14,489 --> 01:41:16,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I know you?</font>

1649
01:41:17,392 --> 01:41:18,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, sir. Uh...</font>

1650
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a visitor from MIT.</font>

1651
01:41:22,262 --> 01:41:23,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. MIT.</font>

1652
01:41:23,730 --> 01:41:25,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got a name?</font>

1653
01:41:25,399 --> 01:41:26,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Howard.</font>

1654
01:41:26,634 --> 01:41:29,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That'll be easy to remember.
- Howard...</font>

1655
01:41:30,237 --> 01:41:31,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Potts.</font>

1656
01:41:31,705 --> 01:41:34,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm Howard Stark.</font>

1657
01:41:34,208 --> 01:41:35,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

1658
01:41:35,075 --> 01:41:36,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shake that, don't pull it.</font>

1659
01:41:36,643 --> 01:41:37,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1660
01:41:38,979 --> 01:41:41,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look a little green around the
gills, there, Potts.</font>

1661
01:41:41,481 --> 01:41:43,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine. Just long hours.</font>

1662
01:41:43,749 --> 01:41:45,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna get some air?</font>

1663
01:41:47,955 --> 01:41:49,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello, Potts.
- Yeah.</font>

1664
01:41:49,922 --> 01:41:51,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That'd be swell.
- That way.</font>

1665
01:41:51,458 --> 01:41:52,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1666
01:41:52,559 --> 01:41:54,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Need your briefcase?</font>

1667
01:41:58,365 --> 01:42:01,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not one of those
beatniks, are you, Potts?</font>

1668
01:42:06,906 --> 01:42:08,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello?
<i>- Doctor Pym?</i></font>

1669
01:42:08,675 --> 01:42:11,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would be the
number that you called, yes.</font>

1670
01:42:11,210 --> 01:42:13,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>This is Captain Stevens
from shipping.</i></font>

1671
01:42:13,714 --> 01:42:14,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We have a package for you.</i></font>

1672
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, bring it up.</font>

1673
01:42:16,583 --> 01:42:18,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That's the thing, sir, we can't.</i></font>

1674
01:42:19,653 --> 01:42:22,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm confused.
I thought that was your job.</font>

1675
01:42:22,488 --> 01:42:23,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Well, it's just...</i></font>

1676
01:42:23,923 --> 01:42:25,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Sir, the box is glowing...</i></font>

1677
01:42:25,626 --> 01:42:26,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and to be honest,</i></font>

1678
01:42:26,959 --> 01:42:28,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>some of our mail guys
aren't feeling that great.</i></font>

1679
01:42:28,594 --> 01:42:30,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They didn't open it, did they?</font>

1680
01:42:30,296 --> 01:42:32,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Uh, yeah, they did.
You better get down here.</i></font>

1681
01:42:33,499 --> 01:42:35,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me! Out of the way!</font>

1682
01:43:02,395 --> 01:43:06,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, flowers and sauerkraut.
You got a big date tonight?</font>

1683
01:43:06,798 --> 01:43:08,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, my wife's expecting.</font>

1684
01:43:08,501 --> 01:43:11,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And too much time at the office.</font>

1685
01:43:13,238 --> 01:43:14,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations.</font>

1686
01:43:14,472 --> 01:43:17,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thanks. Hold this, will ya?
- Yeah, sure.</font>

1687
01:43:17,876 --> 01:43:20,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How far along is she?
- Uh, I don't know.</font>

1688
01:43:21,747 --> 01:43:22,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's at the point where</font>

1689
01:43:22,914 --> 01:43:24,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she can't stand
the sound of my chewing.</font>

1690
01:43:24,482 --> 01:43:28,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I'll be eating
dinner in the pantry again.</font>

1691
01:43:28,987 --> 01:43:30,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a little girl.</font>

1692
01:43:30,322 --> 01:43:31,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A girl would be nice.</font>

1693
01:43:31,856 --> 01:43:34,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Less of a chance she'd
turn out exactly like me.</font>

1694
01:43:34,592 --> 01:43:36,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What'd be so awful about that?</font>

1695
01:43:36,094 --> 01:43:38,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just say
that the greater good</font>

1696
01:43:38,163 --> 01:43:41,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has rarely outweighed
my own self-interest.</font>

1697
01:43:45,437 --> 01:43:47,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you've never seen
these two men before?</font>

1698
01:43:47,105 --> 01:43:48,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I've got an eye for this.
The two of them looked fishy.</font>

1699
01:43:48,807 --> 01:43:49,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you describe them?</font>

1700
01:43:49,873 --> 01:43:51,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of them had a hippie beard.</font>

1701
01:43:51,176 --> 01:43:53,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hippie.
Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?</font>

1702
01:43:53,411 --> 01:43:54,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Definitely Mungo Jerry.</font>

1703
01:43:54,779 --> 01:43:55,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, this is Chesler.</font>

1704
01:43:55,879 --> 01:43:57,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need every available MP
to sublevel 6.</font>

1705
01:43:57,047 --> 01:43:59,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a potential breach.</font>

1706
01:44:16,867 --> 01:44:18,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said bring them in.</font>

1707
01:44:18,035 --> 01:44:19,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're trying, ma'am,
but Braddock's unit</font>

1708
01:44:19,136 --> 01:44:20,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has been stopped
by lightning strikes.</font>

1709
01:44:20,337 --> 01:44:21,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, for the love of...</font>

1710
01:44:21,238 --> 01:44:23,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll look at
the weather projections.</font>

1711
01:44:46,864 --> 01:44:49,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not lightning strikes
we're looking at.</font>

1712
01:45:00,143 --> 01:45:02,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, where you at with names?</font>

1713
01:45:02,044 --> 01:45:05,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if it's a boy,
my wife likes Elmonzo.</font>

1714
01:45:05,281 --> 01:45:07,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh. Might wanna
let that stew awhile.</font>

1715
01:45:07,518 --> 01:45:09,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got time.
- Uh-huh.</font>

1716
01:45:10,186 --> 01:45:12,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me ask you a question.</font>

1717
01:45:12,790 --> 01:45:16,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When your kid was born,
were you nervous?</font>

1718
01:45:16,125 --> 01:45:17,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wildly.</font>

1719
01:45:17,795 --> 01:45:19,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Did you feel qualified?</font>

1720
01:45:19,695 --> 01:45:21,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like you had any idea</font>

1721
01:45:21,464 --> 01:45:23,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how to successfully operate
that thing?</font>

1722
01:45:23,499 --> 01:45:26,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I literally pieced it
together as I went along.</font>

1723
01:45:26,702 --> 01:45:29,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought about what my dad did.</font>

1724
01:45:29,071 --> 01:45:30,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My old man,</font>

1725
01:45:30,373 --> 01:45:32,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he never met a problem he
couldn't solve with a belt.</font>

1726
01:45:32,241 --> 01:45:34,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought my dad
was tough on me.</font>

1727
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:35,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now, looking back on it,</font>

1728
01:45:35,944 --> 01:45:37,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just remember the good stuff.</font>

1729
01:45:37,313 --> 01:45:39,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know? He did drop
the odd pearl.</font>

1730
01:45:39,115 --> 01:45:41,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah? Like what?</font>

1731
01:45:41,517 --> 01:45:44,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"No amount of money ever
bought a second of time."</font>

1732
01:45:45,588 --> 01:45:46,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smart guy.</font>

1733
01:45:46,955 --> 01:45:48,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He did his best.</font>

1734
01:45:49,826 --> 01:45:51,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell you,
that kid's not even here yet</font>

1735
01:45:51,293 --> 01:45:53,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and there's nothing
I wouldn't do for him.</font>

1736
01:46:02,605 --> 01:46:04,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good to meet you, Potts.</font>

1737
01:46:04,506 --> 01:46:05,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1738
01:46:05,842 --> 01:46:09,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Howard...
everything's gonna be all right.</font>

1739
01:46:12,314 --> 01:46:13,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you...</font>

1740
01:46:14,483 --> 01:46:16,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for everything...</font>

1741
01:46:16,084 --> 01:46:18,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you've done for this country.</font>

1742
01:46:21,423 --> 01:46:22,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis.</font>

1743
01:46:26,094 --> 01:46:27,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have we ever met that guy?</font>

1744
01:46:29,731 --> 01:46:31,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You meet a lot of people, sir.</font>

1745
01:46:33,835 --> 01:46:35,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seems very familiar.</font>

1746
01:46:36,471 --> 01:46:38,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weird beard.</font>

1747
01:46:45,814 --> 01:46:47,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're weak.</font>

1748
01:46:47,749 --> 01:46:49,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm you.</font>

1749
01:47:06,333 --> 01:47:08,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could stop this.</font>

1750
01:47:08,837 --> 01:47:11,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know you want to.</font>

1751
01:47:11,238 --> 01:47:13,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you see what happens
in the future?</font>

1752
01:47:14,809 --> 01:47:17,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos finds the Soul Stone.</font>

1753
01:47:18,546 --> 01:47:20,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna know how he does that?</font>

1754
01:47:22,049 --> 01:47:26,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna know
what he does to you?</font>

1755
01:47:26,787 --> 01:47:28,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's enough.</font>

1756
01:47:40,534 --> 01:47:42,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You disgust me.</font>

1757
01:47:43,236 --> 01:47:48,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that doesn't mean
you're useless.</font>

1758
01:48:09,897 --> 01:48:11,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do I look?</font>

1759
01:48:18,338 --> 01:48:19,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

1760
01:48:20,139 --> 01:48:23,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Under different circumstances...</font>

1761
01:48:23,376 --> 01:48:25,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this would be totally awesome.</font>

1762
01:48:37,323 --> 01:48:38,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet the raccoon</font>

1763
01:48:38,891 --> 01:48:40,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">didn't have to climb a mountain.</font>

1764
01:48:40,493 --> 01:48:42,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Technically he's not
a raccoon, you know?</font>

1765
01:48:42,495 --> 01:48:44,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, whatever. He eats garbage.</font>

1766
01:48:44,329 --> 01:48:45,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome.</font>

1767
01:48:48,935 --> 01:48:50,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Natasha.</font>

1768
01:48:50,335 --> 01:48:51,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daughter of Ivan.</font>

1769
01:48:52,805 --> 01:48:54,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clint.</font>

1770
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:56,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of Edith.</font>

1771
01:49:01,781 --> 01:49:03,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

1772
01:49:03,850 --> 01:49:08,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Consider me a guide... to you...</font>

1773
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:10,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and to all who seek
the Soul Stone.</font>

1774
01:49:10,222 --> 01:49:11,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, good.</font>

1775
01:49:11,523 --> 01:49:13,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.</font>

1776
01:49:17,429 --> 01:49:19,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If only it were that easy.</font>

1777
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:35,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you seek
lies in front of you.</font>

1778
01:49:36,882 --> 01:49:39,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As does what you fear.</font>

1779
01:49:44,156 --> 01:49:46,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The stone's down there.</font>

1780
01:49:46,758 --> 01:49:48,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For one of you.</font>

1781
01:49:48,927 --> 01:49:50,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the other...</font>

1782
01:49:53,230 --> 01:49:55,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In order to take the stone...</font>

1783
01:49:55,299 --> 01:49:58,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you must lose
that which you love.</font>

1784
01:49:59,805 --> 01:50:02,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An everlasting exchange.</font>

1785
01:50:03,942 --> 01:50:08,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A soul for a soul.</font>

1786
01:50:10,481 --> 01:50:13,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's it going?</font>

1787
01:50:15,519 --> 01:50:17,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus.</font>

1788
01:50:17,122 --> 01:50:18,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe he's making this shit up.</font>

1789
01:50:19,790 --> 01:50:21,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1790
01:50:21,926 --> 01:50:23,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think so.</font>

1791
01:50:23,494 --> 01:50:25,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?</font>

1792
01:50:27,230 --> 01:50:28,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't.</font>

1793
01:50:29,667 --> 01:50:32,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos left here
with the stone...</font>

1794
01:50:32,903 --> 01:50:34,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without his daughter.</font>

1795
01:50:34,472 --> 01:50:36,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not a coincidence.</font>

1796
01:50:37,808 --> 01:50:39,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1797
01:50:41,078 --> 01:50:42,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever it takes.</font>

1798
01:50:47,383 --> 01:50:48,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever it takes.</font>

1799
01:50:53,289 --> 01:50:55,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we don't get that stone...</font>

1800
01:50:55,391 --> 01:50:57,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">billions of people stay dead.</font>

1801
01:50:58,028 --> 01:50:59,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1802
01:51:00,865 --> 01:51:03,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I guess we both know
who it's got to be.</font>

1803
01:51:03,968 --> 01:51:05,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess we do.</font>

1804
01:51:13,443 --> 01:51:15,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm starting to think</font>

1805
01:51:15,246 --> 01:51:18,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we mean different
people here, Natasha.</font>

1806
01:51:18,615 --> 01:51:20,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the last 5 years,
I've been trying to do one thing.</font>

1807
01:51:20,817 --> 01:51:21,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get to right here.</font>

1808
01:51:21,951 --> 01:51:24,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.</font>

1809
01:51:24,287 --> 01:51:26,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, don't you get
all decent on me now.</font>

1810
01:51:26,589 --> 01:51:29,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, you think I wanna do it?</font>

1811
01:51:29,259 --> 01:51:31,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying to save your life,
you idiot.</font>

1812
01:51:31,194 --> 01:51:34,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, I don't
want you to. How's that?</font>

1813
01:51:34,396 --> 01:51:36,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Natasha, you know
what I've done.</font>

1814
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:40,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I've become.</font>

1815
01:51:42,238 --> 01:51:43,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I don't judge people</font>

1816
01:51:43,405 --> 01:51:44,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on their worst mistakes.</font>

1817
01:51:49,045 --> 01:51:50,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you should.</font>

1818
01:51:51,147 --> 01:51:52,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't.</font>

1819
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:01,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a pain in my ass,
you know that?</font>

1820
01:52:12,168 --> 01:52:13,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1821
01:52:15,137 --> 01:52:16,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You win.</font>

1822
01:52:23,111 --> 01:52:24,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell my family I love 'em.</font>

1823
01:52:28,016 --> 01:52:29,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tell 'em yourself.</font>

1824
01:53:02,084 --> 01:53:03,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn you.</font>

1825
01:53:10,691 --> 01:53:11,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

1826
01:53:19,734 --> 01:53:21,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me go.</font>

1827
01:53:22,803 --> 01:53:23,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1828
01:53:25,405 --> 01:53:26,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Please, no.</font>

1829
01:53:29,911 --> 01:53:31,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

1830
01:53:33,814 --> 01:53:34,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

1831
01:53:36,884 --> 01:53:37,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1832
01:55:19,284 --> 01:55:20,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did we get 'em all?</font>

1833
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:23,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you telling me
this actually worked?</font>

1834
01:55:28,327 --> 01:55:29,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clint, where's Nat?</font>

1835
01:55:58,689 --> 01:55:59,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do we know if she had family?</font>

1836
01:56:01,025 --> 01:56:02,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1837
01:56:02,294 --> 01:56:03,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Us.</font>

1838
01:56:04,829 --> 01:56:05,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1839
01:56:06,764 --> 01:56:07,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

1840
01:56:07,832 --> 01:56:08,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing?
- Just asked him a question.</font>

1841
01:56:08,966 --> 01:56:10,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, no, you're acting
like she's dead.</font>

1842
01:56:10,436 --> 01:56:11,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are we acting
like she's dead?</font>

1843
01:56:11,602 --> 01:56:12,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have the stones, right?</font>

1844
01:56:12,937 --> 01:56:14,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As long as we have the stones...</font>

1845
01:56:14,172 --> 01:56:16,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?</font>

1846
01:56:16,007 --> 01:56:18,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers.
Get it together.</font>

1847
01:56:18,342 --> 01:56:19,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't get her back.</font>

1848
01:56:22,513 --> 01:56:24,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's he...? What?</font>

1849
01:56:24,048 --> 01:56:25,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can't be undone.</font>

1850
01:56:25,883 --> 01:56:27,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can't.</font>

1851
01:56:29,854 --> 01:56:31,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I'm sorry, no offense,</font>

1852
01:56:31,422 --> 01:56:33,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you're a very
earthly being, okay?</font>

1853
01:56:33,091 --> 01:56:34,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we're talking
about space magic.</font>

1854
01:56:34,658 --> 01:56:36,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And "can't" seems very definitive.
Don't you think?</font>

1855
01:56:36,793 --> 01:56:38,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, look, I know
that I'm way outside</font>

1856
01:56:38,362 --> 01:56:39,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my pay grade here.</font>

1857
01:56:39,830 --> 01:56:41,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But she still
isn't here, is she?</font>

1858
01:56:41,499 --> 01:56:42,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's my point.</font>

1859
01:56:42,632 --> 01:56:45,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can't be undone.</font>

1860
01:56:45,735 --> 01:56:47,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or that's at least</font>

1861
01:56:47,138 --> 01:56:49,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what the red,
floating guy had to say.</font>

1862
01:56:49,140 --> 01:56:50,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you wanna go
talk to him, okay?</font>

1863
01:56:50,841 --> 01:56:54,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go grab your hammer and you
go fly and you talk to him.</font>

1864
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was supposed to be me.</font>

1865
01:57:06,756 --> 01:57:09,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.</font>

1866
01:57:09,326 --> 01:57:10,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She bet her life on it.</font>

1867
01:57:15,632 --> 01:57:18,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not coming back.</font>

1868
01:57:19,736 --> 01:57:21,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to make it worth it.</font>

1869
01:57:21,972 --> 01:57:23,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to.</font>

1870
01:57:24,673 --> 01:57:26,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will.</font>

1871
01:57:51,167 --> 01:57:52,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boom!</font>

1872
01:57:57,806 --> 01:58:00,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, the glove's ready.</font>

1873
01:58:00,009 --> 01:58:02,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Question is, who's gonna
snap their freakin' fingers?</font>

1874
01:58:02,811 --> 01:58:05,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll do it.
- Excuse me?</font>

1875
01:58:05,181 --> 01:58:06,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

1876
01:58:06,081 --> 01:58:07,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop, stop. Slow down.</font>

1877
01:58:07,349 --> 01:58:08,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor. Just wait.</font>

1878
01:58:08,884 --> 01:58:11,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.</font>

1879
01:58:11,053 --> 01:58:12,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. What, we're all
just sitting around</font>

1880
01:58:12,788 --> 01:58:14,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">waiting for
the right opportunity?</font>

1881
01:58:14,123 --> 01:58:15,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should at least discuss it.</font>

1882
01:58:15,558 --> 01:58:17,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, sitting here
staring at the thing</font>

1883
01:58:17,593 --> 01:58:19,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is not gonna bring
everybody back.</font>

1884
01:58:20,462 --> 01:58:21,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the strongest Avenger, okay?</font>

1885
01:58:21,931 --> 01:58:23,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, this responsibility
falls upon me.</font>

1886
01:58:23,532 --> 01:58:24,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Normally, you're right.
- It's my duty.</font>

1887
01:58:24,832 --> 01:58:26,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's not about that.
- It's not that.</font>

1888
01:58:26,801 --> 01:58:28,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, buddy...
- Stop it! Just let me.</font>

1889
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:33,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just let me do it.</font>

1890
01:58:33,175 --> 01:58:35,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just let me do something good.
Something right.</font>

1891
01:58:35,910 --> 01:58:37,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, it's not just the fact...</font>

1892
01:58:37,112 --> 01:58:38,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that that glove is channeling
enough energy</font>

1971
02:07:00,306 --> 02:07:01,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened?</font>

1972
02:07:01,574 --> 02:07:04,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mess with time,

1973
02:07:04,010 --> 02:07:05,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll see.</font>

1974
02:07:26,999 --> 02:07:28,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's he been doing?</font>

1975
02:07:30,235 --> 02:07:31,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely nothing.</font>

1976
02:07:33,371 --> 02:07:35,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are the stones?</font>

1977
02:07:35,574 --> 02:07:37,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somewhere under all this.</font>

1978
02:07:38,945 --> 02:07:41,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I know is
he doesn't have 'em.</font>

1979
02:07:41,246 --> 02:07:43,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we keep it that way.</font>

1980
02:07:43,182 --> 02:07:44,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know it's a trap, right?</font>

1981
02:07:44,816 --> 02:07:46,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1982

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't much care.</font>

1983
02:07:48,487 --> 02:07:50,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

1984
02:07:50,255 --> 02:07:52,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just as long
as we're all in agreement.</font>

1985
02:08:02,467 --> 02:08:04,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's kill him
properly this time.</font>

1986
02:08:13,779 --> 02:08:16,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could not live
with your own failure.</font>

1987
02:08:18,315 --> 02:08:20,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did that bring you?</font>

1988
02:08:23,155 --> 02:08:25,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back to me.</font>

1989
02:08:28,392 --> 02:08:32,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought by eliminating
half of life...</font>

1990
02:08:32,063 --> 02:08:34,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the other half would thrive.</font>

1991

1993
02:08:40,638 --> 02:08:44,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And as long as there are those
that remember what was...</font>

1994
02:08:44,209 --> 02:08:45,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there will always be those</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">that are unable to accept
what can be.</font>

1996
02:08:50,182 --> 02:08:51,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They will resist.</font>

1997
02:08:51,782 --> 02:08:53,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep, we're all kinds
of stubborn.</font>

1998
02:08:54,852 --> 02:08:56,520

1999
02:08:58,455 --> 02:09:03,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because now...
I know what I must do.</font>

2000
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:06,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will shred this universe...</font>

2001

<font face="Comic Sans MS">down to its last atom.</font>

2002
02:09:09,033 --> 02:09:10,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then...</font>

2003
02:09:10,701 --> 02:09:13,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the stones
you've collected for me...</font>

2004
02:09:14,004 --> 02:09:18,539

what it has lost...</font>

2006
02:09:20,577 --> 02:09:23,080

2007
02:09:26,150 --> 02:09:27,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A grateful universe.</font>

2008
02:09:28,118 --> 02:09:29,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Born out of blood.</font>

2009
02:09:29,586 --> 02:09:31,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll never know it.</font>

2010
02:09:32,488 --> 02:09:35,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you won't be alive
to tell them.</font>

2011

<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you on the other side, man.</font>

02:39:17,675 --> 02:39:18,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I could let her know.</font>

02:39:21,446 --> 02:39:23,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That we won.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good. You hungry?
- Mm-hmm.</font>

2195
02:39:54,912 --> 02:39:55,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want?</font>

2196
02:39:56,681 --> 02:39:58,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cheeseburgers.</font>

2197
02:40:02,653 --> 02:40:05,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, your dad
liked cheeseburgers.</font>

2198
02:40:05,389 --> 02:40:06,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

02:40:29,546 --> 02:40:31,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So...</font>

2203
02:40:31,081 --> 02:40:33,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when can we expect you back?</font>

2204
02:40:34,885 --> 02:40:36,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, about that...</font>

2205
02:40:36,953 --> 02:40:39,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor, your people need a king.</font>

2206
02:40:39,221 --> 02:40:41,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, they already have one.</font>

2207
02:40:43,225 --> 02:40:44,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's funny.</font>

2208
02:40:49,900 --> 02:40:51,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you being serious?</font>

2209
02:40:55,304 --> 02:40:58,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time for me
to be who I am...</font>

2210
02:40:58,175 --> 02:41:00,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">rather than
who I'm supposed to be.</font>

2211
02:41:02,079 --> 02:41:04,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you, you're a leader.</font>

2212
02:41:04,380 --> 02:41:06,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's who you are.</font>

2213
02:41:08,551 --> 02:41:10,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I'd make
a lot of changes around here.</font>

2214
02:41:10,653 --> 02:41:12,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm counting on it...</font>

02:41:12,588 --> 02:41:13,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Majesty.</font>

2216
02:41:24,100 --> 02:41:25,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What will you do?</font>

2217
02:41:26,068 --> 02:41:27,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure.</font>

2218
02:41:27,536 --> 02:41:29,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the first time
in a thousand years,</font>

2219
02:41:29,839 --> 02:41:31,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no path.</font>

2220
02:41:31,307 --> 02:41:32,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do have a ride though.</font>

2221
02:41:32,975 --> 02:41:35,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move it or lose it, hairbag.</font>

2222
02:41:39,347 --> 02:41:41,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, here we are!</font>

2223
02:41:41,349 --> 02:41:42,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tree, good to see you.</font>

2224
02:41:47,455 --> 02:41:51,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Asgardians of the Galaxy
back together again.</font>

2225
02:41:51,227 --> 02:41:53,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where to first?</font>

2226
02:41:54,230 --> 02:41:55,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

2227
02:41:55,765 --> 02:41:58,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just so you know,
this is my ship still.</font>

2228
02:41:58,067 --> 02:41:59,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm in charge.</font>

2229
02:41:59,501 --> 02:42:02,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. I know.
Of course you are.</font>

2230
02:42:02,270 --> 02:42:03,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

2231
02:42:06,407 --> 02:42:09,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, you say, "Of course,"
but then you touch the map.</font>

2232
02:42:09,178 --> 02:42:10,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It makes you think that maybe</font>

2233
02:42:10,278 --> 02:42:12,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you didn't realize
I was in charge.</font>

2234
02:42:12,280 --> 02:42:13,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quail, that's your own
insecurities in there.</font>

2235
02:42:13,882 --> 02:42:15,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quail?</font>

2236
02:42:15,016 --> 02:42:16,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? I am merely trying</font>

2237
02:42:16,152 --> 02:42:17,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be of service and assisting.</font>

02:42:17,552 --> 02:42:18,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quill.</font>

2239
02:42:18,853 --> 02:42:19,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I said.</font>

2240
02:42:19,988 --> 02:42:22,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.</font>

2241
02:42:22,323 --> 02:42:23,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds fair.</font>

2242
02:42:26,427 --> 02:42:29,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's not necessary, okay?
- It's not.</font>

2243
02:42:29,063 --> 02:42:30,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got some blasters,</font>

2244
02:42:30,131 --> 02:42:31,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">unless you guys
wanna use knives.</font>

2245
02:42:31,499 --> 02:42:34,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes! Please, use knives.</font>

2246
02:42:34,002 --> 02:42:35,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Knives.</font>

2247
02:42:35,203 --> 02:42:36,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Groot.</font>

2248
02:42:42,644 --> 02:42:43,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not necessary.</font>

2249
02:42:43,878 --> 02:42:45,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There shall be
no knifing one another.</font>

2250
02:42:45,579 --> 02:42:48,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody knows who's in charge.</font>

2251
02:42:52,253 --> 02:42:53,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me.</font>

2252
02:42:54,688 --> 02:42:55,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right?</font>

2253
02:42:56,291 --> 02:42:58,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you.</font>

2254
02:42:58,859 --> 02:43:01,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course! Of course.</font>

2255
02:43:01,328 --> 02:43:03,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

2256
02:43:04,865 --> 02:43:07,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember...</font>

2257
02:43:07,168 --> 02:43:08,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you have to return the stones</font>

2258
02:43:08,402 --> 02:43:09,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the exact moment
you got 'em...</font>

2259
02:43:09,536 --> 02:43:10,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or you're gonna open up</font>

2260
02:43:10,604 --> 02:43:13,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a bunch of nasty
alternative realities.</font>

2261
02:43:13,040 --> 02:43:14,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, Bruce.</font>

2262
02:43:14,474 --> 02:43:17,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clip all the branches.</font>

2263
02:43:17,010 --> 02:43:18,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I tried.</font>

2264
02:43:19,847 --> 02:43:22,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I had the gauntlet,
the stones,</font>

2265
02:43:22,115 --> 02:43:24,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really tried
to bring her back.</font>

2266
02:43:27,454 --> 02:43:29,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I miss her, man.</font>

2267
02:43:29,656 --> 02:43:30,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me too.</font>

2268
02:43:34,528 --> 02:43:37,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, if you want,
I could come with you.</font>

2269

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a good man, Sam.</font>

2270
02:43:41,534 --> 02:43:43,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one's on me, though.</font>

2271
02:43:47,540 --> 02:43:49,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't do anything stupid
till I get back.</font>

2272
02:43:51,345 --> 02:43:52,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can I?</font>

2273
02:43:52,678 --> 02:43:54,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're taking
all the stupid with you.</font>

2274
02:44:02,189 --> 02:44:04,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gonna miss you, buddy.</font>

2275
02:44:04,324 --> 02:44:05,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna be okay, Buck.</font>

2276
02:44:13,233 --> 02:44:15,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long is this gonna take?</font>

2277
02:44:15,067 --> 02:44:18,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For him, as long as he needs.
For us, 5 seconds.</font>

2278
02:44:23,142 --> 02:44:24,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ready, Cap?</font>

2279
02:44:24,477 --> 02:44:27,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, we'll meet you
back here, okay?</font>

2280
02:44:27,747 --> 02:44:28,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bet.</font>

2281
02:44:30,249 --> 02:44:31,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Going quantum. 3...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">And returning in 5... 4...</font>

2285
02:44:40,326 --> 02:44:43,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3, 2... 1.</font>

2286
02:44:51,003 --> 02:44:51,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is he?</font>

2287
02:44:51,971 --> 02:44:54,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. He blew
right by his time stamp.</font>

2288
02:44:54,073 --> 02:44:55,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He should be here.</font>

2289
02:45:01,046 --> 02:45:02,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get him back.</font>

2290
02:45:02,148 --> 02:45:03,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm trying.
- Get him the hell back.</font>

2291
02:45:03,349 --> 02:45:05,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, I said I'm trying.
- Sam.</font>

2292

02:45:51,962 --> 02:45:53,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Sam.</font>

2295
02:45:56,567 --> 02:45:59,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?</font>

2296
02:46:01,705 --> 02:46:05,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, after I put the stones
back, I thought...</font>

2297
02:46:06,877 --> 02:46:08,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">maybe...</font>

2298
02:46:08,545 --> 02:46:13,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll try some of that life
Tony was telling me to get.</font>

2299
02:46:15,386 --> 02:46:17,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd that work out for ya?</font>

2300
02:46:20,090 --> 02:46:21,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was beautiful.</font>

2301
02:46:22,693 --> 02:46:24,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. I'm happy for you.</font>
