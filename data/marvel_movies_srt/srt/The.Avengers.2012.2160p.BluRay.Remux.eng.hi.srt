The Tesseract has awakened.

00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:38,872
It is on a little world, a human world.

3

They would wield its power,

4

7
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,271

That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

16
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,842
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

17
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,802
NASA didn't authorize Selvig
to go to test phase.

18
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,221
He wasn't testing it.
He wasn't even in the room.

Where are the energy levels now?

22

shut it down, we ordered evac.

23

How long to get everyone out?

24
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,314

in the next half-hour.

28

the Tesseract's energy,

29
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,241

a minimum safe distance.

30

43
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,981
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- No, it's not funny at all.

The Tesseract is not only
active, she's behaving.

He's called Loki.

332
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,605
He's not from around here.

333
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,525
There's a lot we'll have to
bring you up to speed on

334
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,859
if you're in.

335
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,487
The world has gotten even stranger

336
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,738
than you already know.

337
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,824
At this point, I doubt
anything would surprise me.

338
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,118
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

339
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,539
There's a debriefing packet

340
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,041
waiting for you back at your apartment.

341
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,170
Is there anything you can
tell us about the Tesseract

342
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,672
that we ought to know now?

343
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,299
You should have left it in the ocean.

Good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.

the transmission lines?

PEPPER: Well, assuming
the arc reactor takes over

352
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,012
and it actually works.

353
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:51,638
STARK: I assume.

354
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,848
Light her up.

356
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,524
Like Christmas, but with more me.

00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,359
We've got to go wider on
the public awareness campaign.

358

You need to do some press.

I'm in DC tomorrow,

362
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,701
Enjoy the moment.

Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.

Levels are holding steady, I think.

371
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,526
Of course they are.
I was directly involved.

372
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:47,903
Which brings me to my next question.

373
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,072
How does it feel to be a genius?

374
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,491
Well, I really wouldn't know,
now would I?

375
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:57,204
What do you mean?
All this came from you.

376
00:24:57,371 --> 00:25:00,749
No, all this came from that.

377
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,335
Give yourself some credit. Please.

378

Stark Tower is your baby.

00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,839
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

380
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,466
12%?

An argument can be made for 15.

382
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,678
12%? My baby?

383
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,513
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

384
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,098
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

385
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,017
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

386
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,602
- That was on you.
- Oh.

- My private elevator...
- You mean our elevator?

I'm going to pay for that
comment about percentages

390
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,070
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

391
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,114
It's not going to be that subtle.

392
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,573
I'll tell you what.

393

say "Potts" on the tower.

are being overridden.

- This is urgent.

as soon as possible.

I don't like being handed things.

411
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,987
That's fine, because
I love to be handed things.

And I didn't even qualify.

421
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,214
I didn't know that either.

422
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,551
Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,

424
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,220

Half a mo.

having a moment.

Phil's pretty shaken.

How would you know if it's...
Why is he "Phil"?

432
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,910
What is all this?

433
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,703

Glorious, not lengthy.

in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

823
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,154
An army

824
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,073
from outer space.

825
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,658
So, he's building another portal.

826
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,118
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

827
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,203
Selvig?

828
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,872
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.

829
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,208
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

830
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,834
along with one of ours.

831
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,669
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

832
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,088
He's not leading an army from here.

833
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,964
I don't think
we should be focusing on Loki.

834
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,008
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

835
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:41,343
You could smell crazy on him.

836
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,261
Have care how you speak.

837
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,806
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

838
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,432
And he is my brother.

839
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,518
He killed 80 people in two days.

840
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,478
He's adopted.

841
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:54,022
I think it's about the mechanics.

842
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,191
Iridium... What do they
need the iridium for?

843
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,317
It's a stabilizing agent.

844
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:58,860
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

845
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,529
I'll fly you to Portland.

846
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,322
Keep love alive.

847
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,408
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

848
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,410
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

849
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,871
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.

850
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,332
Also, it means the portal
can open as wide

851
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,001
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

852
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,671
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

853
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,590
That man is playing Galaga.

854
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:25,220
He thought we wouldn't notice,
but we did.

855
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,390
How does Fury even see these?

856
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:29,516
He turns.

857
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,685
Sounds exhausting.

858
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,937
The rest of the raw materials,

859
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,898
Agent Barton can get
his hands on pretty easily.

860
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,525
The only major component
he still needs

861
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:42,195
is a power source
of high-energy density.

862
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:45,490
Something to kick-start the Cube.

863
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:48,577
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

864
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,744
Last night.

865
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,748
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers.

866
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:54,958
Am I the only one who did the reading?

867
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,919
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

868
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,881
He would have to heat the Cube
to 120-million Kelvin

869
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,549
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

870
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,968
Unless Selvig has figured out
how to stabilize

871
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,261
the quantum tunneling effect.

872
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,637
BANNER: Well, if he could do that,

873
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,223
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet.

874
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,726
Finally, someone who speaks English.

875
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:14,769
Is that what just happened?

876
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,105
It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.

877
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:20,400
Your work on antielectron
collisions is unparalleled.

878
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,402
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control

879
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,446
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

880
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,240
Thanks.

881
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,910
Dr. Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

882
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,411
I was hoping you might join him.

883
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,579
ROGERS:
I would start with that stick of his.

884
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:33,914
It may be magical,

885
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,415
but it works an awful lot
like a HYDRA weapon.

886
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:38,418
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

887
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,545
And I would like to know
how Loki used it

888
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,422
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

889
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,257
into his personal flying monkeys.

890
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,134
Monkeys? I do not understand.

891
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:47,219
I do.

892
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,932
I understood that reference.

893
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,476
Shall we play, Doctor?

894
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:56,269
This way, sir.

895
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,952
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

896
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,912
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

897
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,206
But it's going to take weeks to process.

898
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,624
If we bypass their mainframe

899
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,000
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

900
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:22,295
we can clock this
at around 600 teraflops.

901
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,465
All I packed was a toothbrush.

902
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,134
You know, you should come by
Stark Tower sometime.

903
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,303
Top ten floors, all R&D.

904
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,138
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

905
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,891
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York,

906
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,644
I kind of broke Harlem.

907
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,646
Well, I promise
a stress-free environment.

908
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,648
No tension, no surprises.

909
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,066
- (ELECTRIC DISCHARGE)
- Ow!

910
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,568
- ROGERS: Hey!
- Nothing?

911
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:45,735
Are you nuts?

912
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,820
Jury's out.

913
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:48,280
You really have got
a lid on it, haven't you?

914
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,322
What's your secret?

915
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:50,907
Mellow jazz, bongo drums,
huge bag of weed?

916
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:51,992
Is everything a joke to you?

917
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:53,451
Funny things are.

918
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,453
Threatening the safety
of everyone on this ship

919
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,830
isn't funny.

920
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:57,872
No offense, Doc.

921
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,583
It's all right,
I wouldn't have come aboard

922
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:02,544
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

923
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:05,005
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

924
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,048
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr. Stark.

925
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,508
STARK: Do you think I'm not?

926
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,595
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

927
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,388
What isn't he telling us?

928
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,015
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

929
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,975
You think Fury's hiding something?

930
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:20,520
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

931
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,397
His secrets have secrets.

932
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,024
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

933
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:25,066
Uh...

934
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,694
I just want to finish my work here, and...

935
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,362
Doctor?

936
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,329
"A warm light for all mankind."

937
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,372
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

938
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,874
I heard it.

939
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:43,251
I think that was meant for you.

940
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,213
Even if Barton didn't
tell Loki about the tower,

941
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,298
it was still all over the news.

942
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:50,467
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly

943
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:52,927
building in New York?

944
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:57,057
It's powered by an arc reactor,
a self-sustaining energy source.

945
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,601
That building will run itself
for, what, a year?

946
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,561
It's just the prototype.

947
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,480
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

948
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,357
That's what he's getting at.

949
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,068
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him in
on the Tesseract project?

950
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,070
What are they doing
in the energy business

951
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:11,404
in the first place?

952
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:14,574
I should probably look into that
once my decryption program

953
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,660
finishes breaking into all of
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

954
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:17,744
I'm sorry. Did you say...

955
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,913
Jarvis has been running it
since I hit the bridge.

956
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,873
In a few hours,
I'll know every dirty secret

957
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,166
S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.

958
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,250
Blueberry?

959
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,044
Yet you're confused about why
they didn't want you around.

960
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:29,005
An intelligence organization
that fears intelligence?

961
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,965
Historically, not awesome.

962
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,385
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

963
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:35,095
This is a man who means to start a war

964
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:36,596
and if we don't stay focused,
he'll succeed.

965
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,392
We have orders.
We should follow them.

966
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,769
Following's not really my style.

967
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:46,606
And you're all about style, aren't you?

968
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:47,774
Of the people in this room,

969
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:49,484
which one is,
A, wearing a spangly outfit,

970
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:50,735
and, B, not of use?

971
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:55,115
Steve, tell me none of this
smells a little funky to you.

972
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:58,910
Just find the Cube.

973
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,456
(AGENTS TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

974
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,800
STARK: That's the guy
my dad never shut up about?

975
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:16,553
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have
kept him on ice.

976
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:17,971
Huh.

977
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,806
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

978
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:21,683
He does have the jump on us.

979
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:24,519
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

980
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:26,479
It's going to blow up in his face.

981
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,648
And I'm going to be there when it does.

982
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:31,317
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

983
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:34,571
Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up
with the rest of us.

984
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:35,780
(CHUCKLES)

985
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:39,951
You see, I don't get a suit of armor.

986
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:43,413
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

987
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:44,998
It's a nightmare.

988
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:48,209
I've got a cluster of shrapnel
trying every second

989
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,336
to crawl its way into my heart.

990
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,505
This stops it.

991
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,758
This little circle of light,
it's part of me now,

992
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,677
not just armor.

993
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,764
It's a terrible privilege.

994
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,516
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.

995
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,601
It's different.

996
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:08,480
Hey, I read all about your accident.

997
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:11,733
That much gamma exposure
should have killed you.

998
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,527
So you're saying that the Hulk...

999
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,114
The other guy saved my life?

1000
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:19,783
That's nice.

1001
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:24,537
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

1002
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,707
I guess we'll find out.

1003
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,252
You may not enjoy that.

1004
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,338
And you just might.

COULSON: As soon
as Loki took the doctor,

1009
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:35,817
we moved Jane Foster.

1010
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,319
They've got an excellent
observatory in Tromsø.

1011
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:41,990
She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

1012
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:45,910
Handsome fee, private plane,
very remote.

1013
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:47,704
She'll be safe.

1014
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,289
Thank you.

1015
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:52,917
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

1016
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,546
I dread what he plans for him
once he's done.

1017
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,797
Erik is a good man.

1018
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:58,923
He talks about you a lot.

1019
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,969
You changed his life.

1020
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,598
You changed everything around here.

1021
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,808
They were better as they were.

1022
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,519
We pretend on Asgard
that we're more advanced

1023
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:15,356
but we come here,
battling like bilge snipe.

1024
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,317
- Like what?
- Bilge snipe.

1025
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,153
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

1026
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,072
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.

1027
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:25,074
Well, they are repulsive.

1028
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:28,661
And they trample everything
in their path.

1029
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:39,589
When I first came to Earth,
Loki's rage followed me here,

1030
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,925
and your people paid the price.

1031
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,010
And now, again.

1032
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:49,015
In my youth, I courted war.

1033

FURY: War hasn't started yet.

1034
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,730
You think you could make Loki tell us

1035
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:57,148
where the Tesseract is?

1036
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:00,526
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

1037
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:05,365
It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

1038
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,283
There's no pain
would prise his need from him.

1039
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,912
A lot of guys think that

1040
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:12,246
until the pain starts.

1041
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,334
What are you asking me to do?

1042
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:19,879
I'm asking,
what are you prepared to do?

1043
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,047
Loki is a prisoner.

1044
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,675
Then why do I feel like
he's the only person on this boat

1045
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:25,093
that wants to be here?

1046
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:41,067
There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

1047
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,735
But you figured I'd come.

1048
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,904
After.

1049
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:49,409
After whatever tortures
Fury can concoct,

1050
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:53,204
you would appear
as a friend, as a balm.

1051
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,665
And I would cooperate.

1052
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,792
I want to know what
you've done to Agent Barton.

1053
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,877
I would say I've expanded his mind.

1054
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:04,590
And once you've won,

1055
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,426
once you're king of the mountain,

1056
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,264
what happens to his mind?

1057
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:12,306
Oh...

1058
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:14,225
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

1059
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,145
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

1060
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:22,942
Tell me.

1061
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:30,742
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D... I, uh...

1062
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:37,081
Well, I made a name for myself.

1063
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:40,209
I have a very specific skill set.

1064
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:43,713
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

1065
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:48,259
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar
in a bad way.

1066
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:52,597
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

1067
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:54,974
He made a different call.

1068
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:59,979
And what will you do
if I vow to spare him?

1069
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,814
Not let you out.

1070
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,816
No, but I like this.

1071
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:08,029
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

1072
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,448
Regimes fall every day.

1073
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:12,867
I tend not to weep over that.
I'm Russian.

1074
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:13,993
Or I was.

1075
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:16,996
And what are you now?

1076
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:20,666
It's really not that complicated.

1077
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:24,837
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.

1078
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:27,173
Can you?

1079
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:32,512
Can you wipe out that much red?

1080
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,181
Dreykov's daughter,

1081
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:38,726
São Paulo,

1082
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:42,063
the hospital fire?

1083
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:45,483
Barton told me everything.

1084
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:48,402
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

1085
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:51,364
and you think saving a man
no more virtuous than yourself

1086
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:52,824
will change anything?

1087
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:55,618
This is the basest sentimentality.

1088
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:57,995
This is a child at prayer.

1089
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,205
Pathetic!

1090
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:02,792
You lie and kill

1091
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:05,962
in the service of liars and killers.

1092
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:12,051
You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,

1093
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:15,054
something that makes up
for the horrors.

1094
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,641
But they are part of you.

1095
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:22,311
And they will never go away.

1096
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:26,649
I won't touch Barton,
not until I make him kill you.

1097
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:29,026
Slowly, intimately,

1098
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,571
in every way he knows you fear.

1099
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:34,448
And then he'll wake just long
enough to see his good work

1100
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:38,327
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

1101
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:41,247
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,750

1105
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:48,421
Oh, no.

1106
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:50,590
You brought the monster.

1107
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:55,261
So, Banner.

1108
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,430
That's your play.

1109
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,681
What?

1110
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,309
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

1111
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:02,935
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

1112
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,103
Send Thor as well.

1113
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:07,148
Thank you

1114
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:09,609
for your cooperation.

1115
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:18,576
What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

1116
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:21,204
Uh, kind of been wondering
the same thing about you.

1117
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:23,206
You're supposed to be locating
the Tesseract.

1118
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,582
BANNER: We are. The model's locked

1119
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:26,334
and we're sweeping
for the signature now.

1120
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:27,710
When we get a hit,

1121
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:29,295
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

1122
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:33,925
Yeah, then you get your
Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1123
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:35,009
What is "Phase 2"?

1124
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:40,223
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses
the Cube to make weapons.

1125
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,099
Sorry, computer was moving
a little slow for me.

1126
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,936
Rogers, we gathered everything
related to the Tesseract.

1127
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:46,312
This does not mean that we're making...

1128
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:47,355
STARK: I'm sorry, Nick.

1129
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,815
What were you lying?

1130
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,192
I was wrong, Director.

1131
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,443
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1132
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:53,486
Did you know about this?

1133
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:55,488
You want to think about
removing yourself

1134
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:56,697
from this environment, Doctor?

1135
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,658
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.

1136
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:00,284
Loki is manipulating you.

1137
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:01,869
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1138
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:03,496
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

1139
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:04,830
Yes, and I'm not leaving

1140
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,290
because suddenly
you get a little twitchy.

1141
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,209
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1142
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:11,921
is using the Tesseract
to build weapons of mass destruction.

1143
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:13,798
Because of him.

1144
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:15,675
Me?

1145
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:19,428
Last year, Earth had a visitor
from another planet

1146
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:22,723
who had a grudge match
that leveled a small town.

1147
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,934
We learned that
not only are we not alone

1148
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:28,771
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously, outgunned.

1149
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:30,982
My people want nothing
but peace with your planet.

1150
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,234
But you're not the only people
out there, are you?

1151
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:35,194
And you're not the only threat.

1152
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:38,364
The world's filling up with
people who can't be matched,

1153
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:40,366
that can't be controlled.

1154
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:41,742
Like you controlled the Cube?

1155
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,119
Your work with the Tesseract

1156
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,830
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

1157
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,373
It is a signal to all the realms

1158
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:50,126
that the Earth is ready
for a higher form of war.

1159
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,335
A higher form?

1160
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:52,545
You forced our hand.

1161
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:53,587
We had to come up with something.

1162
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:54,714
A nuclear deterrent.

1163
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:56,882
Because that always
calms everything right down.

1164
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:59,385
Remind me again how
you made your fortune, Stark.

1165
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:01,595
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck-deep...

1166
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:03,597
Hold on. How is this now about me?

1167
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:04,849
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1168
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,892
I thought humans were
more evolved than this.

1169

your planet and blow stuff up?

01:29:57,725 --> 01:29:59,060
Yes,

1463
01:30:00,144 --> 01:30:03,565
we were going to build
an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1464
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:06,943
I never put all my chips
on that number, though

1465
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:10,113
because I was playing
something even riskier.

1466
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:18,162
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

1467
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:23,418
called the Avengers Initiative.

1468
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:26,754
The idea was to bring together a group

1469
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:29,424
of remarkable people

1470
01:30:30,174 --> 01:30:33,011
to see if they could become
something more.

1471
01:30:34,345 --> 01:30:38,349
To see if they could work together
when we needed them to,

1472
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:41,811
to fight the battles that we never could.

1473
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:49,694
Phil Coulson died
still believing in that idea.

1474
01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:53,698
In heroes.

1475
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:03,333
Well,

1476
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:06,878
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1477

(GROANS)

1479
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:44,916
Did I hurt anybody?

1480
01:31:45,249 --> 01:31:48,378
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

1481
01:31:48,419 --> 01:31:51,756
You did scare the hell
out of some pigeons, though.

1482
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:53,675
Lucky.

1483
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:55,093
Or just good aim.

1484
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:56,803
You were awake when you fell.

1485
01:31:59,138 --> 01:32:00,932
- You saw?
- The whole thing.

1486
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:02,767
Right through the ceiling.

1487

1488
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:08,314
Here.

1489
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:11,901
Didn't think those would
fit you until you shrunk down

1490
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:14,445
to a regular-size feller.

From outer space, an alien.

1495

No.

1496

Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

You don't understand.

1506

Have you ever had someone
take your brain and play?

1507
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:12,295
Pull you out
and stuff something else in?

1508
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:17,550
Do you know what it's like
to be unmade?

1509
01:33:19,343 --> 01:33:21,512
You know that I do.

1510
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,062
Why am I back?

1511
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:32,899
How did you get him out?

1512
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:35,693

1513
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:38,488
I hit you really hard on the head.

01:33:38,571 --> 01:33:39,697
Thanks.

1517
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:49,123
Don't.

1518
01:33:49,373 --> 01:33:51,459
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1519
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:53,920
This is Loki.

1520
01:33:54,253 --> 01:33:56,672
This is monsters and magic,

1521
01:33:56,714 --> 01:33:58,090
and nothing we were ever trained for.

1522
01:33:58,257 --> 01:33:59,842
Loki, did he get away?

1523
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:00,885
Yeah.

1524
01:34:01,511 --> 01:34:03,596
I don't suppose you know where.

1525
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:05,723
I didn't need to know.

1526
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:07,558
I didn't ask.

1527
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:13,064
He's going to
make his play soon, though.

1528
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:14,482
Today.

1529
01:34:14,732 --> 01:34:15,858
We got to stop him.

1530
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:17,819
Yeah? Who's "we"?

1531
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:19,862
I don't know. Whoever's left.

1532
01:34:21,364 --> 01:34:22,740
Well,

1533
01:34:24,408 --> 01:34:26,577
if I put an arrow
through Loki's eye socket,

1534
01:34:26,702 --> 01:34:29,413
I would sleep better, I suppose.

1535
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:33,584
Now you sound like you.

1536
01:34:34,252 --> 01:34:35,753
But you don't.

1537
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:40,800
You're a spy, not a soldier.

1538
01:34:40,883 --> 01:34:45,638
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

1539
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:49,392
What did Loki do to you?

1540
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:52,562
He didn't. I just...

1541
01:34:56,274 --> 01:34:57,817
Natasha.

1542
01:34:59,902 --> 01:35:01,946
I've been compromised.

1543
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:06,868
I got red in my ledger.

1544
01:35:09,203 --> 01:35:11,330
I would like to wipe it out.

1545
01:35:27,305 --> 01:35:28,890
Was he married?

1546
01:35:28,973 --> 01:35:30,433
No.

1547
01:35:30,474 --> 01:35:34,770
There was a cellist, I think.

1548
01:35:36,314 --> 01:35:37,773
I'm sorry.

1549
01:35:38,441 --> 01:35:39,859
He seemed like a good man.

1550
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,528
He was an idiot.

1551
01:35:42,612 --> 01:35:44,697
Why? For believing?

1552
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,449
For taking on Loki alone.

1553
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:48,284
He was doing his job.

1554
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:50,661
(SCOFFS) He was out of his league.
He should have waited.

1555
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:51,829
He should have...

1556

Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

1557

Right, I've heard that before.

1558
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:57,335
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

1559
01:35:57,668 --> 01:35:59,295
We are not soldiers.

1560

Neither am I.

1562
01:36:07,178 --> 01:36:09,472
He's got the same blood
on his hands that Loki does.

1563
01:36:09,513 --> 01:36:10,973
But right now,
we got to put that behind us

1564
01:36:11,015 --> 01:36:13,017
and get this done.

1565
01:36:13,225 --> 01:36:14,226
Loki needs a power source.

1566
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:15,311
If we can put together a list...

1567
01:36:15,353 --> 01:36:16,354
He made it personal.

1568
01:36:16,687 --> 01:36:17,688
That's not the point.

1569
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:20,274
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

1570
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:22,151
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

1571
01:36:22,526 --> 01:36:23,569
To tear us apart.

1572
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:25,529
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

1573
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:28,157
but he knows he has to
take us out to win, right?

1574
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:29,825
That's what he wants.

1575
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:32,119
He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

1576
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:33,371
He wants an audience.

1577
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:36,040
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

Yeah, that was just previews.
This is opening night.

And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1580
01:36:41,879 --> 01:36:43,506
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

Your brother, the demigod,

1641
01:40:26,937 --> 01:40:30,357
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend.

1642
01:40:30,649 --> 01:40:33,903
A man with breathtaking
anger-management issues,

1643
01:40:33,944 --> 01:40:36,864
a couple of master assassins,
and you, big fella,

1644
01:40:37,656 --> 01:40:40,326
you've managed to piss off
every single one of them.

1645
01:40:40,409 --> 01:40:41,452
That was the plan.

1646
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:43,954
Not a great plan.

1647
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:46,123
When they come,

1648
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:47,666
and they will,

1649
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:48,918
they'll come for you.

1650

You're missing the point.
There is no throne.

1654

There is no version of this
where you come out on top.

1655

Maybe your army comes
and maybe it's too much for us,

01:41:01,805 --> 01:41:03,807
but it's all on you.

1657
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:05,976
Because if we can't protect the Earth,

1658

you can be damn well sure
we'll avenge it.

(CHITAURI POWERING DOWN)

1953
02:07:04,033 --> 02:07:05,868
Come on, Stark.

1954
02:07:06,869 --> 02:07:08,496
(MUFFLED EXPLOSION)

1955
02:07:12,249 --> 02:07:13,417
Close it.

1956
02:07:33,521 --> 02:07:34,522
Son of a gun.

1957
02:07:39,401 --> 02:07:41,070
He's not slowing down.

1958
02:07:59,088 --> 02:08:00,381
Is he breathing?

1959
02:08:22,111 --> 02:08:23,612

1960

(ROARS)

1961
02:08:28,450 --> 02:08:29,660
What the hell?

1962
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:34,748
What just happened?

1963
02:08:34,999 --> 02:08:37,126
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

1964
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:42,840
We won.

1965
02:08:43,674 --> 02:08:44,675
(SIGHS)

1966
02:08:45,384 --> 02:08:46,760
All right, yay!

1967
02:08:46,802 --> 02:08:48,846
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1968
02:08:48,929 --> 02:08:51,891
Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just take a day.

1969
02:08:52,892 --> 02:08:54,310
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1970
02:08:54,977 --> 02:08:57,104
There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here.

1971
02:08:57,187 --> 02:08:58,939
I don't know what it is,
but I want to try it.

1972
02:08:59,481 --> 02:09:00,816
We're not finished yet.

1973
02:09:05,905 --> 02:09:07,823
And then shawarma after.

1974
02:09:12,745 --> 02:09:14,663
(GROANING)

1975
02:09:29,678 --> 02:09:32,014
If it's all the same to you,

1976
02:09:35,225 --> 02:09:36,936
I'll have that drink now.

1977
02:09:44,818 --> 02:09:46,862
Despite the devastation
of what has been confirmed

1978
02:09:46,946 --> 02:09:48,739
as an extraterrestrial attack,

1979
02:09:48,822 --> 02:09:50,366
the extraordinary heroics

1980
02:09:50,491 --> 02:09:52,493
of the group known as the Avengers

1981
02:09:52,534 --> 02:09:54,161
has been to many a cause
not only for comfort,

1982
02:09:54,203 --> 02:09:55,204
but for celebration.

1983
02:09:55,329 --> 02:09:57,831
It's just really great knowing
they're out there.

1984
02:09:57,873 --> 02:09:59,750
That someone is watching over us.

1985
02:09:59,833 --> 02:10:01,085
I love you, Thor!

1986
02:10:01,168 --> 02:10:02,920
And then these guys were like...
(MIMICS LASERS)

1987
02:10:03,003 --> 02:10:04,380
And then the air goes...
(MIMICS EXPLOSION)

1988
02:10:04,421 --> 02:10:05,881
And this green guy walks up
and he goes... (ROARS)

1989
02:10:05,923 --> 02:10:07,049
I don't know.

1990
02:10:07,091 --> 02:10:09,635
I don't exactly feel safer
with those things out there.

1991
02:10:09,718 --> 02:10:12,846
It just seems that there's
a lot they're not telling us.

1992
02:10:12,888 --> 02:10:16,141
Superheroes in New York?
Give me a break.

1993
02:10:16,433 --> 02:10:18,394
These so-called "heroes"

1994
02:10:18,477 --> 02:10:19,853
have to be held responsible

1995
02:10:19,895 --> 02:10:22,147
for the destruction done to this city.

1996
02:10:22,231 --> 02:10:24,400
This was their fight.
Where are they now?

1997
02:10:24,441 --> 02:10:25,776
REPORTER:
Tough questions are being asked

1998
02:10:25,859 --> 02:10:27,361
about the Avengers themselves.

1999
02:10:27,403 --> 02:10:28,487
Their sudden appearance

2000
02:10:28,570 --> 02:10:29,989
and equally sudden disappearance...

2001
02:10:30,072 --> 02:10:32,908
WOMAN: What,
this is all somehow their fault?

2002
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:38,080
Captain America saved my life.

2003
02:10:40,207 --> 02:10:43,752
Wherever he is, and
wherever any of them are,

2004
02:10:43,794 --> 02:10:45,337
I would just...

2005
02:10:46,088 --> 02:10:48,424
I would want to say thank you.

2006
02:10:50,884 --> 02:10:52,428
Where are the Avengers?

2007
02:10:52,761 --> 02:10:54,930
I'm not currently
tracking their whereabouts.

2008
02:10:55,014 --> 02:10:57,266
I'd say they've earned
a leave of absence.

2009
02:10:57,307 --> 02:10:58,934
COUNCILWOMAN: And the Tesseract?

2010
02:10:59,018 --> 02:11:01,103
FURY:
The Tesseract is where it belongs.

2011
02:11:01,729 --> 02:11:04,106
Out of our reach.

2012
02:11:04,314 --> 02:11:05,774
COUNCILMAN 1: That's not your call.

2013
02:11:05,816 --> 02:11:06,859
I didn't make it.

2014
02:11:06,984 --> 02:11:09,069
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

2015
02:11:09,361 --> 02:11:11,030
COUNCILMAN 1: So, you let him take it

2016
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:12,948
and the war criminal, Loki,

2017
02:11:13,032 --> 02:11:14,825
who should be
answering for his crime.

2018
02:11:14,908 --> 02:11:17,244
FURY: Oh, I think he will be.

2019
02:11:30,966 --> 02:11:33,343
COUNCILWOMAN: I don't think you
understand what you've started,

2020
02:11:33,719 --> 02:11:36,013
letting the Avengers
loose on this world.

2021
02:11:36,430 --> 02:11:37,473
They're dangerous.

2022
02:11:37,848 --> 02:11:41,351
FURY: They surely are,
and the whole world knows it.

2023
02:11:42,061 --> 02:11:44,396
Every world knows it.

2024
02:11:45,064 --> 02:11:47,024
Was that the point of all this?

2025
02:11:47,316 --> 02:11:48,859
A statement?

2026
02:11:51,737 --> 02:11:53,238
FURY: A promise.

2027
02:12:01,705 --> 02:12:03,290
HILL: Sir, how does it work now?

2028
02:12:04,583 --> 02:12:06,668
They've gone their separate ways.

2029
02:12:06,710 --> 02:12:09,671
Some, pretty extremely far.

2030
02:12:10,380 --> 02:12:12,382
If we get into a situation like this again,

2031
02:12:12,466 --> 02:12:13,842
what happens then?

2032
02:12:13,884 --> 02:12:14,927
They'll come back.

2033
02:12:16,595 --> 02:12:18,097
HILL: Are you really sure about that?

2034
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:19,181
FURY: I am.

2035
02:12:21,058 --> 02:12:22,351
Why?

2036
02:12:23,352 --> 02:12:25,229
Because we'll need them to.

2037
02:12:41,453 --> 02:12:43,205
(TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING)

2038
02:15:17,109 --> 02:15:19,653
THE OTHER: Humans.

2039
02:15:20,862 --> 02:15:25,284
They are not the cowering
wretches we were promised.

2040
02:15:26,201 --> 02:15:28,370
They stand.

2041
02:15:29,204 --> 02:15:34,418
They are unruly,
and therefore cannot be ruled.

2042
02:15:42,634 --> 02:15:45,554
To challenge them

2043
02:15:45,637 --> 02:15:49,016
is to court death.
