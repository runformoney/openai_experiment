1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:05,923
(METAL CLANGING)

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:10,344
The entire Marvel Cinematic Universe
started in May of 2008

3
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,678
with the release of Iron Man 1.

4
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:15,390
<i>And it really is
an unprecedented journey.</i>

5
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:16,784
LOUIS <i>D'ESPOSITO:
It's been interesting watching</i>

6
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,353
Tony Stark evolve,
there's an emotional resonance.

7
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,063
<i>His relationship with
the other Avengers,</i>

8
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,546
<i>his relationship with Pepper Potts,</i>

9
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,501
his relationship,
most importantly, with himself,

10
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,945
<i>and how that's developed from film
to film has been quite extraordinary.</i>

11
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,240
To see Tony get to a point
where he is introspective,

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,408
<i>where he is thinking about the things</i>

13
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,953
<i>that they have saved over the years
has been amazing.</i>

14
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,121
<i>He is the heart of the Universe.</i>

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,226
ROBERT <i>DOWNEY JR.:
It's just been this</i>

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,293
<i>magical thing that occurred,</i>

17
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,088
this kind of really risky idea of
bringing this whole world to life.

18
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,508
<i>And I think with Thor,
you had Hemsworth in front</i>

19
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:54,346
<i>and there was this very sci-fi version
of a Marvel picture.</i>

20
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,933
In each film, he has grown a greater
affection for Earth and humans

21
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,537
<i>than the first time we saw him,
when he was arrogant.</i>

22
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,895
<i>There can be this great kind of</i>

23
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,481
<i>strength and knowledge
and power with him,</i>

24
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,734
<i>but there's also a naive kid there
at the center of it.</i>

25
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,578
It's nice to have
that contrast and that mix.

26
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,534
<i>His biggest concern is
the well-being of this world.</i>

27
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:19,454
And he very much is sort of looking out
further into the universe,

28
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,749
to make sure that threat
doesn't consume this world as well.

29
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,253
I think the most challenging one
of all of them was Cap.

30
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,838
<i>This kind of guy-out-of-time,</i>

31
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,965
<i>and "Is it too retro?
Are people gonna get it?"</i>

32
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,967
<i>With Evans and Johnston
the first time around,</i>

33
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,362
<i>it was like, "Yes, we get it,
and you get it and you like it."</i>

34
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,556
Initially I'm just trying to build
a foundation of who this guy is.

35
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,100
<i>But you feel like
you know the character now.</i>

36
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,186
<i>FEIGE: The first Captain America film
is subtitled, "The First Avenger,"</i>

37
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,630
because that's really what Cap is.

38
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,898
<i>Born out of the technology
of the 1940s,</i>

39
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,610
<i>frozen in ice, coming back
into the present day.</i>

40
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:50,893
<i>He then goes into the Avengers</i>

41
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,197
and you realize, in a lot of ways, he's
the moral backbone of the Avengers.

42
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,866
- How do we do this?
- As a team.

43
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,159
(ROARS)

44
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,369
<i>D'ESPOSITO: We have Thor,
Cap, the Hulk, Iron Man</i>

45
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,954
<i>finally come together in Avengers.</i>

46
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,832
That was something new
that people had never seen before.

47
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,335
<i>NICK</i> FURY: <i>There was an idea to bring together</i>

48
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,503
<i>a group of remarkable people.</i>

49
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,466
<i>See if they could work together
when we needed them to.</i>

50
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,760
<i>To fight the battles
that we never could.</i>

51
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,471
For us, that's what
an Avengers movie is all about.

52
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,597
<i>How are they gonna react?</i>

53
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,199
<i>Do they like each other?
Do they hate each other?</i>

54
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,392
<i>Do they get along?
Do they become instant best friends?</i>

55
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,354
<i>That is the heart and soul
of an Avengers film.</i>

56
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,522
As the Universe grows,

57
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,442
<i>it's really nice to grow
with the character as I have.</i>

58
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,819
She has a greater calling.

59
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,383
MARK <i>RUFFALO:
Each movie, I am excited</i>

60
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,365
<i>by the idea of reinventing Hulk.</i>

61
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:39,076
Struggle and challenge
just brings out the best of us.

62
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,580
The first Avengers was about them
meeting each other for the first time.

63
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,708
<i>In Age of Ultron, they're getting to
know each other for the first time.</i>

64
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:50,629
There is a real sense of unity
between the Avengers at this point,

65
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,952
so there's something to attack.

66
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,552
My <i>favorite part</i> about
<i>Avengers: Age of Ultron is</i>

67
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,764
a feeling of ending of an era
and the beginning of another,

68
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,766
<i>leading to</i> Captain America: Civil War.

69
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:08,480
<i>Civil</i> War was primarily a conflict
between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark.

70
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:12,025
Cap went from being this guy
who was built by the government

71
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,944
<i>and his allegiance
was to the government,</i>

72
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,154
and it was a blind allegiance.

73
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,699
<i>And Tony was kinda always
flipping the bird to the government,</i>

74
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,117
<i>doing what he wanted to do.</i>

75
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,494
<i>And was kind of
this rogue entrepreneur,</i>

76
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,122
<i>and over the course
of these movies now,</i>

77
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,792
it's just kind of evolved,
and the tables have turned a bit.

78
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,005
<i>JOE</i> RUSSO: Civil <i>War was
an incredibly impactful event</i>

79
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:38,135
that had major ramifications in the
Avengers and in the Marvel Universe.

80
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,725
It's fun to take the characters
that exist to new places.

81
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,185
<i>And then it's equally exciting
to bring in the new players.</i>

82
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,187
<i>And that's why things like
Doctor Strange,</i>

83
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,540
<i>things like</i> Guardians of the Galaxy,

84
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,150
<i>allows you to keep expanding
the tone as you go.</i>

85
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,988
I think all of that just builds
the sort of mystique and mystery

86
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,407
<i>that is part of every movie
that they do.</i>

87
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,576
There is just quite
a great emotional journey

88
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,702
<i>within the films.</i>

89
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,622
What we've seen happen within the
Marvel Universe is this ever-expanding

90
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,082
<i>coterie of superheroes.</i>

91
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,084
<i>And I think now we're at the stage</i>

92
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:14,796
<i>where this universe, even with
our world, has got quite crowded,</i>

93
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,424
and it's just about to explode
into other dimensions.

94
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,385
<i>TONY: I was shown my legacy.</i>

95
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,888
<i>The end of the path I started us on.</i>

96
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,571
Everyone has their
favorite Marvel movie,

97
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,683
and everyone has their
favorite Marvel world,

98
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,978
<i>and just to see
all of them coming together,</i>

99
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,063
<i>it's a daring act.</i>

100
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,857
Who the hell are you guys?

101
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:38,528
Every story that Marvel has told
since Iron Man <i>1</i>

102
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,324
<i>finds a narrative thread
in these next two Avengers movies.</i>

103
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,994
<i>It is a culmination of
all of that storytelling.</i>

104
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,790
With Infinity War, we're paying off
every little thread

105
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,292
<i>and every little tease that we've had</i>

106
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,670
<i>in what will be 18 films
prior to Infinity War.</i>

107
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:56,981
<i>There's never been anything like this,</i>

108
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,258
<i>being able to, film after film,
tease at a larger story,</i>

109
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,845
<i>really building these stories
up into a giant conclusion.</i>

110
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,347
<i>While at the same time,</i>

111
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,433
introducing an entirely
new direction for the future.
