1
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,146
Oh, I've missed this.

2
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,690
Here we go.

3
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,488
This is not the film you're expecting.

4
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,698
<i>This is not the Thor
that you are used to.</i>

5
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,618
Kneel.

6
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,828
In this film,
we have strong female characters.

7
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,665
Don't get familiar.

8
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,417
That makes for a far more interesting
journey to watch.

9
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,211
(GRUNTS)

10
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,506
It's not possible.

11
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,050
You have no idea what's possible.

12
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,305
- What have you done?
- I don't answer to you, lackey.

13
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,225
It's Loki.
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.

14
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,811
- (GROANS)
- Hmm.

15
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,814
WAITITI: <i>Nowadays, we just need
more female actors in films.</i>

16
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,108
<i>Not just characters who look good
in armor and look good</i>

17
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,903
holding a sword, but actually
hold their own against the other guys.

18
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,490
MARK <i>RUFFALO: We have Cate Blanchett
and we have Tessa Thompson,</i>

19
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,992
these two amazing, powerful,

20
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,829
strong, beautiful, intelligent women,

21
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,748
playing these two important,
integral characters.

22
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,376
Want to see what true power
really looks like?

23
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,548
We are introducing what we think is

24
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,801
one of the most iconic villains
in the history of Marvel Comics, Hela.

25
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:36,471
Who is the first female villain
that we've had in a Marvel film.

26
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,141
<i>BRAD WINDERBAUM: Hela is</i> a <i>badass.</i>

27
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,285
Just a character you want to see

28
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:43,186
more of onscreen that's so charismatic.

29
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,439
<i>But at the same time,</i>

30
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,958
<i>you're afraid
of what she's gonna do next.</i>

31
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:50,319
She is as scary, and deadly,
and charming as any

32
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,820
villain we've ever had.

33
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:55,157
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn...

34
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,701
the commander
of the Legions of Asgard...

35
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,455
the rightful heir to the throne,
and the Goddess of Death.

36
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,126
<i>WINDERBAUM: When you're bringing
a character as iconic as Hela</i>

37
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,045
<i>from the Marvel comics to the screen,</i>

38
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,088
you need an actor who

39
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,132
<i>could be the best villain
we've ever had.</i>

40
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,844
<i>So, Cate Blanchett
was obviously the first choice.</i>

41
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:20,682
It seems our father's solution
to every problem was to cover it up.

42
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,059
Or to cast it out.

43
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,186
<i>HEMSWORTH: Cate Blanchett is</i>

44
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,938
one of, if not the, greatest actors.

45
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,608
<i>And I was so excited to see
what she was gonna do.</i>

46
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,944
To have this villainess

47
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:36,490
be introduced in such a strong way
is really exciting.

48
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,290
<i>CATE BLANCHETT: I've had incredible fun
playing with her.</i>

49
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,375
Because I think

50
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,336
her capabilities are so surprising

51
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,881
<i>and so unusual,
she's not simply sinister.</i>

52
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:53,965
MAN: Action!

53
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,050
(GRUNTS)

54
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,803
As somebody who's played the villain

55
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:01,181
in these films,
I understand the responsibilities,

56
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,475
<i>and she has a huge presence,</i>

57
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,019
<i>which she can express
physically or verbally.</i>

58
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:10,315
I'm throwing you. Isn't... Is the...

59
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:15,404
She just has this
off-kilter movement to her character

60
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,614
<i>I was completely blindsided by it.</i>

61
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,801
Some of the happiest times
have been beating people up.

62
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,243
(GRUNTING)

63
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,579
So it's been good.

64
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,209
I think it's great that there is
an elite force of women warriors.

65
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,128
It's about time.

66
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,524
<i>WINDERBAUM: Valkyrie is a big deal for us.</i>

67
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,135
<i>Bringing her to the big screen,
and having her be a new force</i>

68
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:42,180
in the Marvel Universe,
a new, great female heroine

69
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:45,809
<i>who can lead the charge
for the next generation of the MCU.</i>

70
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,063
The Valkyrie were Amazonian.
They were invincible.

71
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,150
They were truly extraordinary beings.

72
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,776
You're a Valkyrie.

73
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,319
(GRUNTS)

74
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,443
I thought the Valkyrie had all died
gruesome deaths.

75
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,116
Choose your next words wisely.

76
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:05,120
<i>THOMPSON: What Taika and what Marvel
has been willing to do</i>

77
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,206
is also stretch the parameters
and find a Valkyrie that's new

78
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,751
- and fresh.
- And... Okay.

79
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,062
I smiled 'cause it felt like
I was on a runway.

80
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,088
(LAUGHING)

81
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:19,342
Today, we're working on kicks
and technique,

82
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,846
and these things, sort of tricks
and spins and stuff.

83
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:28,101
Every day, there's something that's
easier and something that's harder.

84
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,687
I just tell myself a little affirmation,

85
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,273
"You can do this.
It's just a little wind."

86
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,293
<i>THOMPSON: We wanted to find a style</i>

87
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,086
that feels different
than the way that you see

88
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,279
<i>most women fighting in film in general.</i>

89
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,740
(GRUNTING)

90
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,744
I would say that she fights like a boy
except that diminishes the fact

91
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,121
<i>that she just fights like
a really, really strong woman.</i>

92
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:56,421
Tessa has thrown herself at this
in the most extraordinary way.

93
00:04:56,505 --> 00:05:00,592
<i>Just incredible commitment
to the physicality of the part.</i>

94
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,011
The minute she opened the door,

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,430
<i>I went, "Wow, this one's got a history."</i>

96
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:11,102
Tessa was so compelling
and powerful, and mysterious.

97
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,187
Cut.

98
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,689
We talk so much in Hollywood
about representation of women

99
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,692
<i>and we need really strong,
stand-out parts for women.</i>

100
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,822
But we also need women that are
in conflict and are not so great.

101
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,906
MAN: Go!

102
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:24,991
(GRUNTS)

103
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,036
We need representation
all across the board.

104
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,329
You're in my seat.

105
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,291
Women are as capable
and as strong as we are anyway.

106
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,877
<i>And so, they gave in the film,
a different energy.</i>

107
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,547
In this film and in more Marvel films,

108
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,175
<i>we're starting to see women
in these big, heroic parts.</i>

109
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,386
It is inspiring for everybody.

110
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,595
<i>Especially the kids.</i>

111
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,390
To be honest, I expected more.
