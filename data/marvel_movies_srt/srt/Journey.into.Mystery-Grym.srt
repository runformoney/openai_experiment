1
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,564
This Marvel Universe
is something fairly unique.

2
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:23,690
(GRUNTS)

3
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,778
It's never really been done before,
this many films interconnected.

4
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:33,033
The events of Thor: Ragnarok take place
around the same time as <i>Civil</i> War.

5
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,160
Be great if we had Hulk right about now.

6
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,915
So, while everything's
going to hell on Earth,

7
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,209
<i>everything's literally
going to hell in space.</i>

8
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,588
Hulk! Just for once in your life,
don't smash.

9
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,299
Big monster!

10
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,721
It was very important to us to
tap into the history of Marvel Comics.

11
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,560
I was a mad comic collector
when I was young.

12
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:03,230
<i>And this film is
heavily influenced by that style.</i>

13
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,874
<i>WINDERBAUM:
Two comic book runs that we looked at</i>

14
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,985
were the early Jack and Stan stuff,
Journey into Mystery stuff,

15
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,653
as well as the Walt Simonson run,

16
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,407
<i>where he told
the definitive Ragnarok story.</i>

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,537
My idea of a storyline was a mixture
of Norse mythology and Marvel mythology.

18
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:23,458
<i>The story of Surtur and Ragnarok,
the death of the gods.</i>

19
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,711
It's not exactly
the same story in our film,

20
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:29,047
<i>but there are iconic aspects
that we're embracing.</i>

21
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:32,092
<i>Surtur being key to
the ultimate destruction of Asgard.</i>

22
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:37,264
<i>The brothers, Thor and Loki, having to
work together in order to save the day,</i>

23
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,640
<i>despite their differences.</i>

24
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:39,850
It's the only way.

25
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,936
<i>These are all things that are
really important to the Ragnarok story.</i>

26
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,939
I am Asgard's doom!

27
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,817
You get so much information,
so many storylines from the comics.

28
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,695
<i>It's really fun for me to
figure out which cool things to take.</i>

29
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,699
Jack Kirby is arguably
the most important comic book artist.

30
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,870
<i>We are directly referencing
a lot of his art which is very iconic.</i>

31
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,705
Get him. Open a window.

32
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:06,126
FEIGE: <i>All of the Thor films
have always been inspired by his work,</i>

33
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,919
but in this particular movie,

34
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:11,548
Taika had an idea to just
really make it a tribute to Jack Kirby.

35
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,050
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard...

36
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,778
and you're not gonna have to think about
the Hulk ever again. All right?

37
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,803
All right.

38
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,722
(CROWD CHEERING)

39
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,307
Hulk! Hulk!

40
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,437
This film, to me, seems like the perfect
environment in which to show his style.

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,023
<i>His line, his color, everything.</i>

42
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,985
It's almost as if we have finally
stepped into a Jack Kirby drawing.

43
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,657
WAITITI: <i>He's created so many incredible
characters, and ships and costumes.</i>

44
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,158
He really blazed the trail.

45
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:42,663
<i>And it's about time that someone
paid tribute to him in this way.</i>

46
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:43,973
<i>I mean, he really was the king.</i>

47
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,500
Get up. You're in my seat.

48
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,920
It's incredible what the character of
Hela means to the fans

49
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,673
<i>and what her history
with the comics has been.</i>

50
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:53,965
I'm Hela.

51
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,009
I'm just a janitor.

52
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,719
You look like a smart boy.

53
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,306
There's an incredible, fantastic element
to her power.

54
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,559
She was born with a rare gift

55
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:08,397
to create any number
of deadly weapons at her whim.

56
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,252
ERIC <i>PEARSON: There's a run of Thor
called "God of Thunder,"</i>

57
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:17,823
where there was a character named Gorr
going around killing gods.

58
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,700
<i>And it's a really fun comic to read.</i>

59
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:24,579
<i>And we used a lot of the visual aspect
of Gorr's powers to infuse with Hela.</i>

60
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,207
Want to see what true power
really looks like?

61
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,667
(GROWLS)

62
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,757
We were able to tap into something
from the comics which is very exciting,

63
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:39,344
<i>which our storylines have taken Hulk
to other sides of the universe.</i>

64
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,516
MARK <i>RUFFALO:
Everybody wants Planet Hulk.</i>

65
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,310
<i>Planet Hulk</i> is a legendary Marvel comic.

66
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,271
It's beloved by fans.

67
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,290
<i>PEARSON: This was not going to
be the Planet Hulk movie,</i>

68
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,816
<i>but we were using elements of it</i>

69
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,153
<i>where Hulk ends up on
a very different-looking Sakaar</i>

70
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,780
and is forced to be a gladiator.

71
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:02,117
We spun it and we've given
a lot of that story to Thor

72
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,786
<i>while also introducing Hulk
in the same context.</i>

73
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,456
(ROARS)

74
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,292
I really wanted to
have Hulk with battle armor,

75
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,535
<i>with the shoulder pads, and the spikes,
and everything.</i>

76
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,731
WINDERBAUM:
<i>Marvel's</i> Contest of Champions

77
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:18,300
<i>is something we're excited to
bring to the screen for Marvel fans.</i>

78
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:25,390
And one of the allies that Thor makes
is this Kronan named Korg.

79
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,100
I really wish I had my hammer.

80
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,829
Sounds like you had a pretty special and
intimate relationship with this hammer

81
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,898
and that losing it was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.

82
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,067
<i>WINDERBAUM: He was a character
from the Planet Hulk storyline</i>

83
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:40,489
<i>and also poetically is
of the first breed of aliens</i>

84
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,825
<i>that Thor had to fight in his first
issue of Journey Into Mystery.</i>

85
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,747
(ALL EXCLAIM)

86
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,541
Anyone else?

87
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:55,796
We kind of make this a fairly unique
film of its own and story.

88
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,798
But Ragnarok has already begun.

89
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,092
As long as you stay true
to the core of the characters,

90
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,594
<i>then it's just a big playground.</i>

91
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,012
For Asgard.

92
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,223
WAITITI: <i>Just</i> a <i>chance to play around
and be</i> a <i>bit mad</i>

93
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,350
and make it feel
a little bit more like a comic.

94
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,018
You can't defeat me.

95
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,269
But he can.

96
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,898
The fans are always
front-of-mind for us.

97
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,902
<i>Not just the fans of today,
but also the fans from years ago.</i>

98
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,613
<i>These are characters
that have been around for decades.</i>

99
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:25,408
<i>So, the excitement that someone had
reading a new story for the first time</i>

100
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,054
is the same excitement we hope they feel
when they go to the movies

101
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,789
<i>and see the latest interpretation
of the character onscreen.</i>
