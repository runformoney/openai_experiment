<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this a joke?</font>

249
00:19:31,012 --> 00:19:32,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you thinking?
- What?</font>

250
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you thinking?
- Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy.</font>

251
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:37,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're angry about something.</font>

252
00:19:37,602 --> 00:19:38,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have the sniffles?
I don't wanna get sick.</font>

253
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:40,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you just donate...
- Keep your business.</font>

254
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:44,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...our entire modern art collection
to the...</font>

255
00:19:44,192 --> 00:19:45,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Boy Scouts of America.
- ...Boy Scouts of America?</font>

256
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:47,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation.</font>

257
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:51,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't physically check the crates
but, basically, yes.</font>

258
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's not "our" collection,
it's my collection. No offence.</font>

259
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you know what?
I think I'm actually entitled</font>

260
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to say "our" collection</font>

261
00:19:57,288 --> 00:20:00,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">considering the time that I put in,
over 10 years,</font>

262
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- curating that.
- It was a tax write-off. I needed that.</font>

263
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:05,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
there's only about 8,011 things</font>

264
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I really need to talk to you about.</font>

265
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:09,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out.</font>

266
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:10,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Bridgeport's
already machining that part.</font>

267
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:13,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.</font>

268
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:15,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to wear a surgical mask
until you're feeling better.</font>

269
00:20:15,598 --> 00:20:16,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that okay?
- That's rude.</font>

270
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:18,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing more important to me
than the Expo.</font>

271
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:19,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my primary point of concern.</font>

272
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:22,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't know why you're...
- The Expo is your ego gone crazy.</font>

273
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:24,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. Look at that.</font>

274
00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:28,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's modern art. That's going up.</font>

275
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:31,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You've got to be kidding.
- I'm gonna put this up right now.</font>

276
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is vital.
- Stark is in complete disarray.</font>

277
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:35,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You understand that?
- No. Our stocks have never been higher.</font>

278
00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:38,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, from a managerial standpoint.
- You are... Well, if it's messy,</font>

279
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:39,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- then let's double back.
- Let me give you an example.</font>

280
00:20:39,998 --> 00:20:41,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's move on to another subject.
- No, no, no, no.</font>

281
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are not taking down
the Barnett Newman</font>

282
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:44,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and hanging that up!
- I'm not taking it down.</font>

283
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just replacing it with this.</font>

284
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's see what I can get going here.
- Okay, fine.</font>

285
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My point is,
we have already awarded contracts</font>

286
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- to the wind farm people.
- Yeah. Don't say "wind farm."</font>

287
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:54,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm already feeling gassy.
- And to the plastic plantation tree,</font>

288
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:57,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which was your idea, by the way.
Those people are on payroll...</font>

289
00:20:57,181 --> 00:20:58,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Everything was my idea.
- ...and you won't make a decision.</font>

290
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care
about the liberal agenda any more.</font>

291
00:21:00,852 --> 00:21:03,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's boring. Boring.
I'm giving you a boring alert.</font>

292
00:21:03,313 --> 00:21:05,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You do it.
- I do what?</font>

293
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excellent idea. I just figured this out.
You run the company.</font>

294
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:10,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, I'm trying to run the company.
- Pepper, I need you to run the company.</font>

295
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:11,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
- You will not</font>

296
00:21:12,113 --> 00:21:13,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- give me the information...
- I'm not asking you to try...</font>

297
00:21:13,865 --> 00:21:14,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ...in order to...
- I'm asking you</font>

298
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to physically do it. I need you to do it.</font>

299
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:18,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I am trying to do it.
- Pepper, you're not listening to me!</font>

300
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:20,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, you are not listening to me.
- I'm trying to make you CEO.</font>

301
00:21:20,204 --> 00:21:22,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why won't you let me?</font>

302
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:25,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Have you been drinking?
- Chlorophyll.</font>

303
00:21:27,545 --> 00:21:31,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hereby irrevocably appoint you
chairman and CEO of Stark Industries,</font>

304
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:33,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">effective immediately.</font>

305
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, done deal. Okay?</font>

306
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:41,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've actually given this
a fair amount of thought,</font>

307
00:21:42,018 --> 00:21:45,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">believe it or not.
Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak,</font>

308
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:49,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">trying to figure out
who a worthy successor would be.</font>

309
00:21:49,984 --> 00:21:51,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then I realised</font>

310
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:56,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's you. It's always been you.</font>

311
00:21:58,868 --> 00:21:59,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought there'd be a legal issue,</font>

312
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:03,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but actually I'm capable
of appointing my successor.</font>

313
00:22:04,248 --> 00:22:06,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My successor being you.</font>

314
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:10,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations?</font>

315
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Take it, just take it.
- I don't know what to think.</font>

316
00:22:13,508 --> 00:22:15,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't think. Drink.</font>

317
00:22:19,597 --> 00:22:21,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you go.</font>

318
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:05,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The notary's here! Can you please
come sign the transfer paperwork?</font>

319
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:07,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm on happy time.</font>

320
00:23:13,985 --> 00:23:15,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry.
- What the hell was that?</font>

321
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called mixed martial arts.
It's been around for 3 weeks.</font>

322
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:19,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called dirty boxing.
There's nothing new about it.</font>

323
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:22,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, put them up. Come on.</font>

324
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:29,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise you this is the only time
I will ask you to sign over your company.</font>

325
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to initial each box.</font>

326
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:36,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lesson one. Never take your eye off...</font>

327
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it. I'm done.</font>

328
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:42,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's your name, lady?
- Rushman. Natalie Rushman.</font>

329
00:23:43,014 --> 00:23:44,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Front and centre. Come into the church.</font>

330
00:23:44,682 --> 00:23:48,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No. You're seriously not gonna ask...
- lf it pleases the court, which it does.</font>

331
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's no problem.
- I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.</font>

332
00:24:05,453 --> 00:24:06,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

333
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:13,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can you give her a lesson?
- No problem.</font>

334
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pepper.
- What?</font>

335
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:18,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who is she?
- She is from legal.</font>

336
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:22,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she is potentially a very expensive
sexual harassment lawsuit</font>

337
00:24:23,012 --> 00:24:25,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- if you keep ogling her like that.
- I need a new assistant, boss.</font>

338
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:28,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, and I've got
three excellent potential candidates.</font>

339
00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:29,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're lined up and ready to meet you.</font>

340
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:32,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have time to meet.
I need someone now. I feel like it's her.</font>

341
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:33,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's not.</font>

342
00:24:33,898 --> 00:24:35,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You ever boxed before?
- I have, yes.</font>

343
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:39,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot
Camp? Crunch? Something like that?</font>

344
00:24:39,821 --> 00:24:43,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How do I spell your name, Natalie?
- R-U-S-H-M-A-N.</font>

345
00:24:43,658 --> 00:24:48,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What, are you gonna google her now?
- I thought I was ogling her.</font>

346
00:24:48,162 --> 00:24:51,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wow. Very, very impressive individual.
- You're so predictable, you know that?</font>

347
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:54,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's fluent in French, Italian,
Russian, Latin.</font>

348
00:24:54,168 --> 00:24:56,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who speaks Latin?
- No one speaks Latin.</font>

349
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:58,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No one speaks Latin?
- It's a dead language.</font>

350
00:24:58,506 --> 00:25:00,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can read Latin
or you can write Latin,</font>

351
00:25:00,383 --> 00:25:01,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- but you can't speak Latin...
- Did you model in Tokyo?</font>

352
00:25:02,051 --> 00:25:03,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 'Cause she modelled in Tokyo.
- Well...</font>

353
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:05,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need her.
She's got everything that I need.</font>

354
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:08,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rule number one,
never take your eye off your opponent.</font>

355
00:25:10,184 --> 00:25:11,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

356
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:16,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Happy!
- That's what I'm talking about.</font>

357
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:17,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I just slipped.
- You did?</font>

358
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:20,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Looks like a TKO to me.</font>

359
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just... I need your impression.</font>

360
00:25:25,074 --> 00:25:27,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a quiet reserve.
I don't know, you have an old soul.</font>

361
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:30,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I meant your fingerprint.
- Right.</font>

362
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:36,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So, how are we doing?
- Great. Just wrapping up. Hey.</font>

363
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:41,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're the boss.
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?</font>

364
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:43,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Yes, that will be all, Ms. Rushman.</font>

365
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:45,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you very much.</font>

366
00:25:48,181 --> 00:25:49,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I want one.
- No.</font>

367
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:26,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, it's Europe.
Whatever happens the next 20 minutes,</font>

368
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:27,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- just go with it.
- Go with it? Go with what?</font>

369
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mr. Stark?
- Hey.</font>

370
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello. How was your flight?</font>

371
00:26:30,473 --> 00:26:31,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was excellent.
Boy, it's nice to see you.</font>

372
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:36,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have one photographer
from the ACM, if you don't mind. Okay?</font>

373
00:26:36,312 --> 00:26:38,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- When did this happen?
- What? You made me do it.</font>

374
00:26:38,481 --> 00:26:40,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I made you do what?
- You quit. Smile. Look right there.</font>

375
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:42,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop acting constipated.</font>

376
00:26:42,318 --> 00:26:43,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't flare your nostrils.
- You are so predictable.</font>

377
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:44,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's the amazing thing.
- Right this way.</font>

378
00:26:44,988 --> 00:26:46,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You look fantastic.
- Why, thank you very much.</font>

379
00:26:46,781 --> 00:26:48,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that's unprofessional.
What's on the docket?</font>

380
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a 9:30 dinner.</font>

381
00:26:50,702 --> 00:26:52,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Perfect. I'll be there at 11:00.
- Absolutely.</font>

382
00:26:52,537 --> 00:26:54,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is this us?
- It can be.</font>

383
00:26:54,455 --> 00:26:56,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Great. Make it us.
- Okay.</font>

384
00:26:56,207 --> 00:26:58,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mr. Musk. How are you?
- Hi, Pepper.</font>

385
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Thank you very much.</font>

386
00:27:00,712 --> 00:27:02,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elon, how's it going?
Those Merlin engines are fantastic.</font>

387
00:27:03,047 --> 00:27:05,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. Yeah, I've got an idea
for an electric jet.</font>

388
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:06,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You do?
- Yeah.</font>

389
00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:08,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we'll make it work.</font>

390
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You want a massage?
- Oh, God. No,</font>

391
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:11,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't want a massage.
- I'll have Natalie make an...</font>

392
00:27:11,806 --> 00:27:13,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't want Natalie to do...
- Don't want you tense.</font>

393
00:27:13,308 --> 00:27:14,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way, I didn't mean
to spring this on you.</font>

394
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you very much.</font>

395
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:17,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Green is not your best colour.
- Oh, please.</font>

396
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:19,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anthony! Is that you?</font>

397
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:20,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My least favourite person on Earth.
- Hey, pal.</font>

398
00:27:20,815 --> 00:27:22,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Justin Hammer.
- How you doing?</font>

399
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:24,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not the only rich guy here
with a fancy car.</font>

400
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:27,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know Christine Everhart
from Vanity Fair.</font>

401
00:27:27,572 --> 00:27:28,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You guys know each other?
- Hi.</font>

402
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:29,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- Yes.</font>

403
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:31,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, roughly.
- We do.</font>

404
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:35,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">BTW, big story.
The new CEO of Stark Industries.</font>

405
00:27:35,496 --> 00:27:36,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I know. I know.
- Congratulations.</font>

406
00:27:36,873 --> 00:27:40,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My editor will kill me if I don't grab
a quote for our Powerful Women issue.</font>

407
00:27:40,418 --> 00:27:41,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can I?
- Sure.</font>

408
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:44,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's actually doing a big spread on me
for Vanity Fair.</font>

409
00:27:44,255 --> 00:27:46,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.</font>

410
00:27:46,257 --> 00:27:47,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right.
- Right?</font>

411
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:50,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, she did quite a spread
on Tony last year.</font>

412
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:52,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she wrote a story as well.</font>

413
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:54,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It was very impressive.
- That was good.</font>

414
00:27:54,432 --> 00:27:56,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Very well done.
- Thank you.</font>

415
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm gonna go wash.
- Don't leave me.</font>

416
00:27:58,102 --> 00:27:59,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, buddy. How you doing?
- I'm all right.</font>

417
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:00,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Looking gorgeous.
- Please, this is tough.</font>

418
00:28:01,022 --> 00:28:03,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can I ask you... Is this the first time...
- <i>Fromage.</i></font>

419
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:05,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Say, "Brie."
- ...that you guys have seen each other?</font>

420
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:07,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, that's so awful.</font>

421
00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:09,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, is it the first time you've seen
each other since the Senate?</font>

422
00:28:10,114 --> 00:28:11,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since he got his contract revoked...</font>

423
00:28:11,866 --> 00:28:14,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Actually, it's on hold.
- ...when you were attempting to...</font>

424
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not what I heard.
What's the difference between "hold"</font>

425
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:18,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and "cancelled"? The truth?
- Yes, what is?</font>

426
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:20,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. The truth is...
Why don't we put that away?</font>

427
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:24,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The truth is, I'm actually hoping
to present something at your Expo.</font>

428
00:28:24,712 --> 00:28:27,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if you invent something
that works,</font>

429
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:28,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll make sure I get you a slot.</font>

430
00:28:28,675 --> 00:28:30,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mr. Stark, your corner table is ready.
- Yes?</font>

431
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:33,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.</font>

432
00:28:33,262 --> 00:28:36,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hammer needs a slot, Christine.
- We kid, yeah.</font>

433
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:38,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We kid. We're kidders.</font>

434
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:02,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got any other bad ideas?</font>

435
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:08,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony!</font>

436
00:29:12,093 --> 00:29:16,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony and I... Tony... I love Tony Stark.
Tony loves me. We're not competitors.</font>

437
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:18,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Him being out of the picture
created tremendous opportunities</font>

438
00:29:19,017 --> 00:29:21,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for Hammer Industries, you know?</font>

439
00:29:21,602 --> 00:29:24,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Everything that Tony and I do...
- <i>Well, what's the use of having...</i></font>

440
00:29:25,023 --> 00:29:27,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ...is a healthy...
- <i>... and owning a race car...</i></font>

441

- <i>... if you don't drive it?</i></font>

442
00:29:31,988 --> 00:29:33,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he driving?</font>

443
00:29:40,788 --> 00:29:42,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Natalie. Natalie!</font>

444
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:44,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, Miss Potts?
- Did you know about this?</font>

445
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:46,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the first that I have known of it.</font>

446
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:48,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This... This cannot happen.</font>

447
00:29:48,838 --> 00:29:50,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely. I understand.
How can I help you?</font>

448
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where's Happy?
- He's waiting outside.</font>

449
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:53,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, get him. I need Happy.
- Right away.</font>

450
00:29:54,552 --> 00:29:56,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony's... You know, he...</font>

451
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:58,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not competitive.
You know what I mean?</font>

452
00:29:58,723 --> 00:29:59,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,</font>

453
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:02,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- can you excuse me just one second?
- Just read me what you wrote.</font>

454
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:04,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I will. I will, after.
- Just read it back to me.</font>

455
00:30:04,228 --> 00:30:05,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I have to make one quick phone call.</font>

456
00:30:05,563 --> 00:30:06,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where are you going?
- This is great.</font>

457
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:08,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I've got some caviar coming.
- This is great stuff.</font>

00:30:08,191 --> 00:30:09,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll be right back.
- Look!</font>

459
00:30:09,776 --> 00:30:11,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Stark.</font>

460
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go!</font>

461
00:32:14,108 --> 00:32:15,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on.</font>

462
00:33:24,345 --> 00:33:26,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Give me the case.
- Here. Take it.</font>

463

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where's the key?
- It's in my pocket.</font>

464

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Car!</font>

465
00:34:32,747 --> 00:34:34,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

466
00:34:40,755 --> 00:34:43,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you okay?
- Yeah.</font>

467
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:46,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Were you heading for me or him?
- I was trying to scare him.</font>

468
00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:48,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 'Cause I can't tell!
- Are you out of your mind?</font>

469
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:50,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Better security.
- Get in the car right now!</font>

470
00:34:50,515 --> 00:34:52,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was attacked! We need better security.</font>

471

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get in the car!
- You're CEO. Better security measures.</font>

472
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:56,396

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

475
00:35:06,698 --> 00:35:08,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I got him!

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Football.</font>

477
00:35:13,371 --> 00:35:15,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I got him!
- Take the case! Take it!</font>

478
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:17,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Take the case!
- Give him the case!</font>

479
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop banging the car!</font>

480
00:35:22,213 --> 00:35:23,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Calm down.</font>

481
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:26,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God! God!</font>

482
00:35:29,095 --> 00:35:31,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me the case! Please! Come on!</font>

483
00:37:04,232 --> 00:37:05,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You... You lose.</font>

484
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lose. You lose, Stark.</font>

485
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:12,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty decent tech.
Cycles per second were a little low.</font>

486
00:38:17,847 --> 00:38:20,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could have doubled up
your rotations.</font>

487
00:38:23,478 --> 00:38:26,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You focused the repulsor energy
through ionised plasma channels.</font>

488
00:38:26,314 --> 00:38:29,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's effective. Not very efficient.</font>

489
00:38:30,276 --> 00:38:32,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's a passable knock-off.</font>

490
00:38:33,529 --> 00:38:34,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't get it. A little fine tuning,</font>

491
00:38:34,906 --> 00:38:36,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you could have made a solid paycheck.</font>

492
00:38:36,783 --> 00:38:40,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could have sold it
to North Korea, China, Iran,</font>

493
00:38:41,037 --> 00:38:43,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or gone right to the black market.</font>

494
00:38:43,748 --> 00:38:46,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like you got friends
in low places.</font>

495
00:38:46,793 --> 00:38:52,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You come from a family
of thieves and butchers.</font>

496
00:38:53,716 --> 00:38:55,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now, like all guilty men,</font>

497
00:38:56,928 --> 00:38:59,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you try to rewrite your own history.</font>

498
00:39:00,223 --> 00:39:05,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you forget all the lives
the Stark family has destroyed.</font>

499
00:39:06,396 --> 00:39:09,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speaking of thieves,
where did you get this design?</font>

500
00:39:09,732 --> 00:39:12,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father. Anton Vanko.</font>

501
00:39:13,861 --> 00:39:15,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I never heard of him.</font>

502
00:39:17,115 --> 00:39:19,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father is the reason you're alive.</font>

we are a lot alike in a lot of ways.</font>

00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:26,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking at you.</font>

633
00:49:26,766 --> 00:49:29,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna do
this whole lone gunslinger act</font>

634
00:49:29,894 --> 00:49:31,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's unnecessary.
You don't have to do this alone.</font>

635
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:34,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I wish I could believe that.
I really do.</font>

636
00:49:34,315 --> 00:49:36,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you've gotta trust me.</font>

637
00:49:36,651 --> 00:49:40,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Contrary to popular belief,
I know exactly what I'm doing.</font>

638
00:49:49,205 --> 00:49:51,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is where we do it.
This is my humble abode.</font>

639
00:49:51,582 --> 00:49:55,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can work in absolute peace.
Must be fun to be dead, right?</font>

640
00:49:55,128 --> 00:49:56,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No pressure.</font>

641
00:49:56,629 --> 00:49:59,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here they are. I'm very excited.
They're combat-ready.</font>

642
00:49:59,716 --> 00:50:01,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I may have done a few miscalculations</font>

643
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:03,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and rushed the prototype
into production.</font>

644
00:50:03,344 --> 00:50:05,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sue me, I'm enthusiastic.</font>

645
00:50:05,305 --> 00:50:07,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go ahead, take a look around.</font>

646
00:50:12,395 --> 00:50:14,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't wanna do that.</font>

647
00:50:14,397 --> 00:50:15,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be able to access that</font>

648
00:50:16,107 --> 00:50:17,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as soon as we generate
some encrypted pass codes.</font>

649
00:50:18,109 --> 00:50:20,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we generate
some encrypted pass codes?</font>

650
00:50:20,278 --> 00:50:23,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get some of those
encrypted pass codes, Jack.</font>

651
00:50:24,574 --> 00:50:26,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never mind, I...</font>

652
00:50:27,493 --> 00:50:30,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. Okay. Good stuff.</font>

653
00:50:33,249 --> 00:50:35,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry?
- Software shit.</font>

654
00:50:37,837 --> 00:50:39,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

655
00:50:40,548 --> 00:50:41,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're good.</font>

656
00:50:42,258 --> 00:50:45,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really blasted in
past the firewall there.</font>

657
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:49,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me show you where
you're gonna be working primarily.</font>

658
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:51,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go ahead, take a look.</font>

659
00:50:52,477 --> 00:50:55,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get a good look at that.
That's something, isn't it?</font>

660
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:57,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
those are really just for show and tell.</font>

661
00:50:57,273 --> 00:51:02,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're $125.7 million a pop, so...
Wait! Oh, gosh.</font>

662
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:07,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here.</font>

663
00:51:08,117 --> 00:51:10,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's where the pilot goes.</font>

664
00:51:10,787 --> 00:51:14,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm having a tough time
finding volunteers.</font>

665
00:51:14,916 --> 00:51:18,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take care of that, just leave it.</font>

666
00:51:18,169 --> 00:51:19,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you want them do?</font>

667
00:51:19,754 --> 00:51:24,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, long term, I want them to put me
in the Pentagon for the next 25 years.</font>

668
00:51:25,051 --> 00:51:27,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to make Iron Man
look like an antique.</font>

669
00:51:27,178 --> 00:51:28,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna go to that Stark Expo,</font>

670
00:51:28,388 --> 00:51:30,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna take a dump
in Tony's front yard.</font>

671
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:31,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I'm talking about?</font>

672
00:51:31,891 --> 00:51:34,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can do that. No problem.
- Yeah?</font>

673
00:51:34,143 --> 00:51:36,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, fabulous! I love it.</font>

674
00:51:36,396 --> 00:51:39,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, this is our guy. Didn't I tell you?
I had a feeling.</font>

675
00:51:48,658 --> 00:51:51,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know which watch
you'd like to wear tonight, Mr. Stark?</font>

676
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:53,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll give them a look.</font>

677
00:51:56,332 --> 00:51:57,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should cancel the party.</font>

678
00:51:58,876 --> 00:52:00,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Probably.
- Yeah.</font>

679
00:52:00,211 --> 00:52:02,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 'Cause it's...
- Ill-timed.</font>

680
00:52:02,922 --> 00:52:04,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, sends the wrong message.</font>

681
00:52:04,507 --> 00:52:05,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Inappropriate.</font>

682
00:52:11,848 --> 00:52:14,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that dirty enough for you?</font>

683
00:52:15,101 --> 00:52:18,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gold face, brown band.
The Jaeger. I'll give that a look.</font>

684
00:52:19,397 --> 00:52:20,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring them over here.</font>

685
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:26,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take that. Why don't you...</font>

686
00:52:38,374 --> 00:52:40,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta say it.
It's hard to get a read on you.</font>

687
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where are you from?
- Legal.</font>

688
00:52:45,882 --> 00:52:47,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I ask you a question,
hypothetically?</font>

689
00:52:48,092 --> 00:52:49,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bit odd.</font>

690
00:52:49,677 --> 00:52:53,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If this was your last birthday party
you were ever gonna have,</font>

691
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:54,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how would you celebrate it?</font>

692
00:52:57,393 --> 00:53:01,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd do whatever I wanted to do
with whoever I wanted to do it with.</font>

693
00:53:32,178 --> 00:53:34,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good evening.
- Good evening.</font>

694
00:53:35,306 --> 00:53:37,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir, I understand.</font>

695
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:41,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, sir, that will not be necessary.
I'll handle it.</font>

696
00:53:41,688 --> 00:53:43,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I personally guarantee
that within 24 hours,</font>

697
00:53:44,107 --> 00:53:45,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iron Man will be back on watch.</font>

698
00:53:53,241 --> 00:53:54,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Pepper.</font>

699
00:53:55,034 --> 00:53:57,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to go get some air.</font>

700
00:53:57,245 --> 00:53:58,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong?</font>

701
00:53:59,414 --> 00:54:01,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't know what to do.
- You gotta be kidding me.</font>

702
00:54:07,922 --> 00:54:10,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's it. I'm making... Pepper.
- No, no, no. Don't call anyone.</font>

703
00:54:10,633 --> 00:54:12,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is ridiculous.
I just stuck my neck out for this guy.</font>

704
00:54:12,635 --> 00:54:13,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. I know. I get it.</font>

705
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna handle it, okay?
Just let me handle it.</font>

706
00:54:15,305 --> 00:54:18,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Handle it. Or I'm gonna have to.</font>

707
00:54:19,434 --> 00:54:21,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You know, the question</i>
<i>I get asked most often is,</i></font>

708
00:54:21,185 --> 00:54:23,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"Tony, how do you go to the bathroom</i>
<i>in the suit?"</i></font>

709
00:54:27,066 --> 00:54:28,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Just like that.</i></font>

710
00:54:32,155 --> 00:54:35,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Does this guy know</i>
<i>how to throw a party or what?</i></font>

711
00:54:38,786 --> 00:54:39,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I love you.</i></font>

712
00:54:39,912 --> 00:54:42,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Unbelievable! Thank you so much.</i></font>

713
00:54:42,665 --> 00:54:46,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Tony, we all thank you so much</i>
<i>for such a wonderful night.</i></font>

714
00:54:46,711 --> 00:54:50,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And we're gonna say good night now,</i>
<i>and thank you all for coming.</i></font>

715
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:51,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No, no, no, we can't... Wait, wait, wait.</i></font>

716
00:54:52,091 --> 00:54:53,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We didn't have the cake.
We didn't blow out the candles.</font>

717
00:54:53,968 --> 00:54:56,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're out of control, okay?
Trust me on this one, okay?</font>

718
00:54:56,846 --> 00:54:59,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're out of control, gorgeous.
- It's time to go to bed. It's time.</font>

719
00:54:59,265 --> 00:55:00,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Give me another smooch.
- You're not going to be</font>

720
00:55:00,475 --> 00:55:01,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- happy about this.
- Come on, you know you want to.</font>

721
00:55:01,768 --> 00:55:03,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just peed the suit.</font>

722
00:55:03,227 --> 00:55:04,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I know. It has a filtration system.
- It's not sexy.</font>

723
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:06,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could drink that water.</font>

724
00:55:06,648 --> 00:55:09,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just send everybody home, okay?
It's time to...</font>

725
00:55:09,942 --> 00:55:11,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- lf you say so.
- Okay.</font>

726
00:55:11,778 --> 00:55:13,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take this, you take that.</font>

727
00:55:15,365 --> 00:55:16,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Pepper Potts.</i></font>

728
00:55:18,284 --> 00:55:19,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>She's right. The party's over.</i></font>

729
00:55:19,911 --> 00:55:22,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Then again, the party was over for me,</i>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The after-party starts in 15 minutes.</i></font>

731
00:55:30,046 --> 00:55:34,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if anybody, Pepper,
doesn't like it, there's the door.</font>

732
00:55:40,682 --> 00:55:42,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

733
00:55:46,437 --> 00:55:47,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hit!</font>

734
00:55:54,862 --> 00:55:56,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull!</font>

735
00:56:05,331 --> 00:56:06,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull!</font>

736

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't deserve to wear one of these.
Shut it down!</font>

to beat my buddy's ass to.</font>

743
00:56:55,798 --> 00:56:57,759

744
00:57:08,311 --> 00:57:11,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, put that thing back where
you found it before someone gets hurt.</font>

745
00:57:18,613 --> 00:57:19,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

746

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, pal,
but Iron Man doesn't have a sidekick.</font>

00:57:31,834 --> 00:57:34,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sidekick this!</font>

748

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Had enough?</font>

749
00:57:45,014 --> 00:57:46,432

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.
I don't wanna get off on the wrong foot.</font>

I was tasked to you by Director Fury.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You made your girl your CEO,
you're giving away all your stuff.</font>

792
01:02:42,312 --> 01:02:45,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You let your friend

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, if I didn't know better...</font>

I didn't give it to him. He took it.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?</font>

796
01:02:51,696 --> 01:02:54,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're Iron Man and he just took it?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">The little brother walked in there,
kicked your ass and took your suit?</font>

798
01:02:57,869 --> 01:02:59,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that possible?</font>

799
01:02:59,162 --> 01:03:01,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, according to Mr. Stark's

a problem I have to deal with.</font>

you are not the centre of my universe.</font>

It's gonna take the edge off.</font>

I'll be right as rain.</font>

813
01:03:42,455 --> 01:03:44,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a cure,
it just abates the symptoms.</font>

814
01:03:44,457 --> 01:03:46,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't look like it's gonna be

That's the bird. This is the bird.</font>

826
01:04:21,995 --> 01:04:24,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Pulled a lot of strings

What is that?</font>

It doesn't look like a helmet to me.</font>

837
01:05:06,414 --> 01:05:08,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How... How are you supposed
to get a head in there?</font>

838
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:10,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jack, could you put your head in there?
- No.</font>

He can't put his head in there.</font>

The government wants suits.</font>

01:05:49,248 --> 01:05:52,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what the people want.
That's what's gonna make them happy.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You told me I hadn't tried everything.</font>

891
01:07:52,872 --> 01:07:55,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean I haven't
tried everything? What haven't I tried?</font>

892
01:07:55,166 --> 01:07:59,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said that you were the only person
with the means and knowledge</font>

893
01:07:59,545 --> 01:08:01,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to finish what he started.</font>

894
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:03,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said that?</font>

895
01:08:03,299 --> 01:08:05,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you that guy? Are you?</font>

896
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:11,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause if you are, then you can solve
the riddle of your heart.</font>

897
01:08:15,603 --> 01:08:17,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know
where you get your information,</font>

898
01:08:17,146 --> 01:08:19,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but he wasn't my biggest fan.</font>

899
01:08:19,482 --> 01:08:20,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you remember
about your dad?</font>

900
01:08:20,942 --> 01:08:22,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was cold, he was calculating.</font>

901
01:08:22,735 --> 01:08:25,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He never told me he loved me.
He never even told me he liked me,</font>

902
01:08:25,571 --> 01:08:27,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so it's a little tough for me to digest</font>

903
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you're telling me he said
the whole future was riding on me</font>

904
01:08:29,784 --> 01:08:32,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.</font>

905
01:08:32,829 --> 01:08:34,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're talking about a guy
whose happiest day</font>

906
01:08:34,163 --> 01:08:35,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was when he shipped me
off to boarding school.</font>

907
01:08:35,748 --> 01:08:36,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not true.</font>

908
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:39,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then, clearly you knew my dad
better than I did.</font>

909
01:08:40,003 --> 01:08:43,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of
the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.</font>

910
01:08:43,756 --> 01:08:44,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

911
01:08:45,466 --> 01:08:47,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I got a 2:00.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.</font>

912
01:08:47,635 --> 01:08:49,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's this?
- Okay, you're good, right?</font>

913
01:08:49,262 --> 01:08:50,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, I'm not good.
- You got this? Right? Right?</font>

914
01:08:51,097 --> 01:08:52,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got what? I don't even know
what I'm supposed to get.</font>

915
01:08:53,057 --> 01:08:56,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Natasha will remain a floater at Stark
with her cover intact.</font>

916

- Yeah.</font>

917
01:08:59,731 --> 01:09:01,190

918

I'll put in a little time at the lab.</font>

932
01:10:12,261 --> 01:10:13,846

933
01:10:13,972 --> 01:10:18,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Major, this is not a scientific exercise.
Let's just focus on arming it, all right?</font>

934
01:10:19,894 --> 01:10:21,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

935

938
01:10:27,402 --> 01:10:30,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got it.
What did you do? What did you do?</font>

939
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:36,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes, it is.</font>

940

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm talking about firepower.</font>

945
01:10:51,759 --> 01:10:53,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you're talking to the right guy.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Claridge Hi-Tec,
semi-automatic, 9mm pistol.</font>

01:11:19,704 --> 01:11:22,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're looking at
a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher.</font>

965
01:11:46,564 --> 01:11:47,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

966
01:11:49,567 --> 01:11:53,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are the Cubans, baby.
This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos.</font>

967
01:11:55,031 --> 01:11:56,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle</font>

under the bunker you just busted.</font>

970
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it were any smarter,
it would write a book.</font>

971
01:12:07,752 --> 01:12:11,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A book that would make Ulysses
look like it was written in crayon.</font>

972
01:12:11,756 --> 01:12:13,549

1100
01:19:51,466 --> 01:19:54,510

1108
01:20:14,989 --> 01:20:17,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which means? Wait. What?
What did you just say?</font>

1109
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It means you can either drive yourself
home or I can have you collected.</font>

01:46:23,308 --> 01:46:24,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So let's put the biggest gun
up on that ridge.</font>

1396
01:46:24,976 --> 01:46:26,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got you.</font>

1397
01:46:27,103 --> 01:46:28,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where do you want to be?
- Where are you going?</font>

1398
01:46:28,271 --> 01:46:29,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What're you talking about?
- I meant me.</font>

1399
01:46:29,981 --> 01:46:31,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a big gun.
You are not the big gun.</font>

1400
01:46:32,066 --> 01:46:33,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tony, don't be jealous.
- No. It's subtle,</font>

1401
01:46:33,526 --> 01:46:34,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- all the bells and whistles.
- Yeah.</font>

1402
01:46:34,777 --> 01:46:37,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's called being a badass.
- Fine.</font>

1403
01:46:37,989 --> 01:46:41,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.
You go up top. I'll draw them in.</font>

1404
01:46:41,451 --> 01:46:43,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't stay down here.
This is the worst place to be.</font>

1405
01:46:43,411 --> 01:46:44,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you got a spot. Where's mine?</font>

1406
01:46:44,746 --> 01:46:47,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the kill box, Tony. Okay?
This is where you go to die.</font>

1407
01:47:37,382 --> 01:47:39,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- See that?
- Yeah, yeah, nice.</font>

1408
01:47:47,183 --> 01:47:48,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rhodey?</font>

1409
01:47:49,811 --> 01:47:51,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down.</font>

1410
01:48:01,531 --> 01:48:03,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. I think
you should lead with that next time.</font>

1411
01:48:04,075 --> 01:48:07,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Sorry, boss.
I can only use it once. It's a one-off.</font>

1412
01:48:09,831 --> 01:48:11,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you that 5 minutes ago.</font>

1413
01:48:13,293 --> 01:48:14,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's your guy here.</font>

1414
01:48:16,045 --> 01:48:18,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excuse me?
- You're being placed under arrest.</font>

1415
01:48:18,131 --> 01:48:19,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you kidding me?
- Hands behind your back, sir.</font>

1416
01:48:19,674 --> 01:48:21,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying to help here.</font>

1417
01:48:25,430 --> 01:48:28,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get it. I see what you're doing.
You're trying to pin this on me, huh?</font>

1418
01:48:29,058 --> 01:48:30,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's good. That's good.</font>

1419
01:48:30,727 --> 01:48:33,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're starting to think like a CEO,
taking out the competition.</font>

1420
01:48:33,813 --> 01:48:36,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like that. You think you're making
a problem for me?</font>

1421
01:48:36,316 --> 01:48:37,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna make a problem for you.</font>

1422
01:48:37,483 --> 01:48:40,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna be seeing you again
real soon.</font>

1423
01:48:44,699 --> 01:48:46,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When they get here,
I think you should station them</font>

1424
01:48:46,284 --> 01:48:49,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at the south, east and both west exits.</font>

1425
01:48:49,203 --> 01:48:51,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We shut down the 7 train
in and out of Willets Point already.</font>

1426
01:48:51,372 --> 01:48:54,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, have city buses there
to ferry people to operating lines.</font>

1427
01:48:54,250 --> 01:48:55,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Are you coming with us?</font>

1428
01:48:55,877 --> 01:48:59,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, I'm gonna stay till the park is clear.
- Okay.</font>

1429
01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:03,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heads up.
You got one more drone incoming.</font>

1430
01:49:03,718 --> 01:49:05,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one looks different.</font>

1431
01:49:05,511 --> 01:49:07,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The repulsor signature</i>
<i>is significantly higher.</i></font>

1432
01:49:18,983 --> 01:49:20,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good to be back.</font>

1433
01:49:21,235 --> 01:49:22,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This ain't gonna be good.</font>

1434
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:28,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got something special for this guy.</font>

1435
01:49:28,409 --> 01:49:30,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna bust his bunker
with the Ex-Wife.</font>

1436
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:32,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With the what?</font>

1437
01:49:42,465 --> 01:49:44,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hammer tech?
- Yeah.</font>

1438
01:49:46,803 --> 01:49:48,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got this.</font>

1439
01:50:41,316 --> 01:50:43,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rhodes. I got an idea.</font>

1440
01:50:43,693 --> 01:50:46,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You want to be a hero?
- What?</font>

1441
01:50:46,529 --> 01:50:49,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could really use a sidekick.
Put your hand up.</font>

1442
01:50:49,574 --> 01:50:51,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is your idea?
- Yep.</font>

1443
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:54,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm ready. I'm ready. Go, go, go!</font>

1444
01:50:58,541 --> 01:50:59,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it.</font>

1445
01:51:28,196 --> 01:51:29,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lose.</font>

1446
01:51:37,163 --> 01:51:39,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All these drones are rigged to blow.
We gotta get out of here, man.</font>

1447
01:51:40,416 --> 01:51:41,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pepper?</font>

1448
01:52:21,833 --> 01:52:23,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God! I can't take this any more.</font>

1449
01:52:23,668 --> 01:52:25,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You can't?
- I can't take this.</font>

1450
01:52:25,169 --> 01:52:26,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look at me.
- My body, literally,</font>

1451
01:52:26,671 --> 01:52:27,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">cannot handle the stress.</font>

1452
01:52:28,006 --> 01:52:32,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never know if you're gonna kill yourself
or wreck the whole company.</font>

1453
01:52:32,594 --> 01:52:34,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I did okay.</font>

1454
01:52:34,762 --> 01:52:36,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I quit. I'm resigning.</font>

1455
01:52:37,432 --> 01:52:38,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it.</font>

1456
01:52:39,392 --> 01:52:41,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you just say? You're done?</font>

1457
01:52:43,271 --> 01:52:46,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's surprising.
No, it's not surprising. I get it.</font>

1458
01:52:47,191 --> 01:52:50,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You don't have to make any excuses.
- I'm... I'm... I'm not making any excuses.</font>

1459
01:52:50,570 --> 01:52:51,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You actually were just making excuses.</font>

1460
01:52:51,779 --> 01:52:53,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But you don't have to.
- No, I wasn't making an excuse.</font>

1461
01:52:53,364 --> 01:52:54,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm actually very justified.
- Listen. Hey, hey.</font>

1462
01:52:54,782 --> 01:52:57,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You deserve better.
- Well...</font>

1463
01:52:57,201 --> 01:52:59,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've taken such good care of me.</font>

1464
01:53:00,663 --> 01:53:03,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been in a tough spot,
but you got me through it, so...</font>

1465
01:53:03,166 --> 01:53:04,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right?</font>

1466
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:05,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- Yeah.</font>

1467
01:53:06,544 --> 01:53:09,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you for understanding.
- Yeah, yeah. Let's talk clean-up.</font>

1468
01:53:09,589 --> 01:53:12,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll handle the transition. It'll be smooth.
- Okay. What about the press?</font>

1469
01:53:12,342 --> 01:53:14,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you only had
the job for a week. That's gonna seem...</font>

1470
01:53:14,302 --> 01:53:15,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, with you it's like dog years.
- I know.</font>

1471
01:53:16,095 --> 01:53:17,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, it's like the Presidency...</font>

1472
01:53:30,526 --> 01:53:31,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weird.</font>

1473
01:53:32,028 --> 01:53:33,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, it's not weird.
- It's okay, right?</font>

1474
01:53:33,613 --> 01:53:35,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Run that by me again.</font>

1475
01:53:35,615 --> 01:53:37,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it was weird.</font>

1476
01:53:37,909 --> 01:53:40,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys look like two seals
fighting over a grape.</font>

1477
01:53:41,412 --> 01:53:43,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I had just quit, actually.
- Yeah, so we're not...</font>

1478
01:53:43,957 --> 01:53:46,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to do that.
I heard the whole thing.</font>

1479
01:53:46,542 --> 01:53:49,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You should get lost.
- I was here first. Get a roof.</font>

1480
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:52,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I thought you were out of one-liners.
- That's the last one.</font>

1481
01:53:53,007 --> 01:53:55,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You kicked ass back there, by the way.
- Thank you. You, too.</font>

1482
01:53:55,718 --> 01:53:58,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, my car got taken out
in the explosion,</font>

1483
01:53:58,304 --> 01:54:01,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I'm gonna have to hang on
to your suit for a minute, okay?</font>

1484
01:54:01,557 --> 01:54:03,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not okay. Not okay with that.</font>

1485
01:54:03,893 --> 01:54:05,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't a question.</font>

1486
01:54:10,733 --> 01:54:14,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you gonna resign
if I don't accept?</font>

1487
01:54:33,923 --> 01:54:36,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think I want you looking at that.</font>

1488
01:54:37,010 --> 01:54:39,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure it pertains to you any more.</font>

1489
01:54:39,262 --> 01:54:44,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now this, on the other hand,
is Agent Romanoff's assessment of you.</font>

1503
01:55:25,683 --> 01:55:28,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can you approve me
but not approve me?</font>

1510
01:55:54,379 --> 01:55:56,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then again,
I will waive my customary retainer</font>
