1
00:00:48,773 --> 00:00:50,138
On your left.

2
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,148
On your left.

3
00:01:02,173 --> 00:01:04,221
Uh-huh. On my left. Got it.

4
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:11,388
Don't say it. Don't you say it.

5
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:12,983
- On your left.
- Come on!

6
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,868
Oh!

7
00:01:21,813 --> 00:01:23,383
Need a medic?

8
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:27,868
I need a new set of lungs.

9
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:31,215
Dude, you just ran,
like, 13 miles in 30 minutes.

10
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,413
I guess I got a late start.

11
00:01:32,573 --> 00:01:35,019
Really? You should
be ashamed of yourself.

12
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:37,739
You should take another lap.

13
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:39,981
Did you just take it?
I assume you just took it.

14
00:01:40,453 --> 00:01:41,739
What unit you with?

15
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:43,298
58th Pararescue.

16
00:01:43,493 --> 00:01:45,018
But now I'm working down at the VA.

17
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:47,337
- Sam Wilson.
- Steve Rogers.

18
00:01:47,493 --> 00:01:49,655
I kind of put that together.

19
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:53,299
Must have freaked you out, coming
home after the whole defrosting thing.

20
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,859
It takes some getting used to.

21
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:57,424
It's good to meet you, Sam.

22
00:01:57,853 --> 00:01:58,854
It's your bed, right?

23
00:02:00,093 --> 00:02:01,015
What's that?

24
00:02:01,173 --> 00:02:02,618
Your bed, it's too soft.

25
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:04,423
When I was over there,
I'd sleep on the ground,

26
00:02:04,653 --> 00:02:06,542
use rock for pillows, like a caveman.

27
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:09,857
Now I'm home, lying in my bed,
and it's like...

28
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:11,213
Lying on a marshmallow.

29
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,053
Feel like I'm gonna sink
right to the floor.

30
00:02:14,373 --> 00:02:15,668
How long?

31
00:02:15,693 --> 00:02:16,979
Two tours.

32
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,493
You must miss the good old days, huh?

33
00:02:20,413 --> 00:02:22,859
Well, things aren't so bad.

34
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:25,508
Food's a lot better.
We used to boil everything.

35
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:26,868
No polio is good.

36
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:28,179
Internet, so helpful.

37
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:30,293
I've been reading that a lot,
trying to catch up.

38
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:35,904
Marvin Gaye, 1972,
Trouble Man soundtrack.</i>

39
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:38,539
Everything you missed
jammed into one album.

40
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,701
I'll put it on the list.

41
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,018
All right, Sam, duty calls.
Thanks for the run.

42
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:52,584
If that's what you want to call running.

43
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:53,828
Oh, that's how it is?

44
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:55,413
- Oh, that's how it is.
- Okay.

45
00:02:56,573 --> 00:02:58,894
Any time you want to stop by the VA,
make me look awesome

46
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:02,421
in front of the girl at the front desk,
just let me know.

47
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:04,223
- I'll keep it in mind.
- Yeah.

48
00:03:08,213 --> 00:03:09,738
Hey, fellas.

49
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:11,908
Either one of you
know where the Smithsonian is?

50
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:13,139
I'm here to pick up a fossil.

51
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:14,574
That's hilarious.

52
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,578
- How you doing?
- Hey.

53
00:03:22,053 --> 00:03:23,388
Can't run everywhere.

54
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:24,414
No, you can't.

55
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,468
Target is a mobile
satellite launch platform,

56
00:03:34,493 --> 00:03:35,619
<i>the Lemurian Star.</i>

57
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:38,413
They were sending up their last payload
when pirates took them,

58
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:39,979
93 minutes ago.

59
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:41,942
- Any demands?
- Billion and a half.

60
00:03:42,093 --> 00:03:44,253
- Why so steep?
- Because it's S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

61
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,943
So it's not off-course. It's trespassing.

62
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:49,623
I'm sure they have a good reason.

63
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:51,502
You know, I'm getting a little
tired of being Fury's janitor.

64
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:53,536
Relax. It's not that complicated.

65
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,908
How many pirates?

66
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:57,459
25. Top mercs led by this guy.

67
00:03:58,253 --> 00:04:01,735
Georges Batroc.
Ex-DGSE, Action Division.

68
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:03,822
He's at the top of Interpol's Red Notice.

69
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,662
Before the French demobilised him,
he had 36 kill missions.

70
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:09,668
This guy's got a rep
for maximum casualties.

71
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:10,988
Hostages?

72
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:13,903
Oh, mostly techs. One officer.
Jasper Sitwell.

73
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:15,813
They're in the galley.

74
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:17,493
What's Sitwell doing on a launch ship?

75
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:19,496
All right, I'm gonna
sweep the deck and find Batroc.

76
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,138
Nat, you kill the engines
and wait for instructions.

77
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:24,179
Rumlow, you sweep aft,
find the hostages,

78
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,188
get them to the life-pods, get them out.
Let's move.

79
00:04:26,213 --> 00:04:27,813
S.T.R.I.K.E., you heard the Cap.
Gear up.

80
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:42,588
Secure channel 7.

81
00:04:42,613 --> 00:04:43,828
7 secure.

82
00:04:43,853 --> 00:04:45,378
Did you do anything fun
Saturday night?

83
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:49,021
Well, all the guys
from my barbershop quartet are dead,

84
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:50,788
so, no, not really.

85
00:04:50,813 --> 00:04:53,020
<i>Coming up on the drop zone, Cap.</i>

86
00:04:53,213 --> 00:04:56,217
You know, if you ask Kristen out,
from Statistics, she'd probably say yes.

87
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:58,100
That's why I don't ask.

88
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:01,617
Too shy, or too scared?

89
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:03,744
Too busy!

90
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:06,783
Was he wearing a parachute?

91
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,020
No.

92
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:09,700
No, he wasn't.

93
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:11,939
Ahh!

94
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:19,668
Ahh!

95
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,134
Hey!

96
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:05,014
Don't move.

97
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:10,214
Thanks.

98
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:12,455
Yeah. You seemed pretty
helpless without me.

99
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:18,828
What about the nurse that
lives across the hall from you?

100
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:19,988
She seems kind of nice.

101
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:21,788
Secure the engine room,
then find me a date.

102
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:23,468
I'm multi-tasking.

103
00:07:24,813 --> 00:07:25,860
I told Batroc...

104
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,453
If we want to make S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us...

105
00:07:27,693 --> 00:07:29,775
...start sending them bodies now!

106
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:33,701
I have a bullet for someone...

107
00:07:34,493 --> 00:07:36,018
You want a bullet in your head?

108
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:38,133
Move that foot you want
a bullet in the head?

109
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:39,864
Huh?

110
00:07:47,853 --> 00:07:49,696
I don't like waiting.

111
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:51,974
Call Durand.

112
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:55,348
I want this ship ready to move
when the ransom comes.

113
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:04,054
Start the engines.

114
00:08:04,373 --> 00:08:05,454
Okay.

115
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:07,814
Hey, sailor.

116
00:08:27,613 --> 00:08:28,614
Shut up.

117
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:32,254
You want to be a hero? Is that it?

118
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:40,940
All right, I've waited long enough...

119
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:45,588
Hey!

120
00:08:45,613 --> 00:08:46,668
Find Batroc...

121
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,694
If I don't hear anything in two minutes...

122
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:49,054
...I start killing them!

123
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:50,254
I'll find him.

124
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:00,215
2 minutes.

125
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,980
Radio silence
from S.H.I.E.L.D., Batroc...

126
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,380
Targets acquired.

127
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:41,140
S.T.R.I.K.E. in position.

128
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:43,373
Natasha, what's your status?

129
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:46,974
<i>Status, Natasha.</i>

130
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:48,134
Hang on!

131
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:05,339
Engine room secure.

132
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:15,054
Time is up.

133
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:18,057
Who dies first...?

134
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,494
You!

135
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:21,614
Get that one.

136
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:25,174
On my mark.

137
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:27,984
<i>3...</i>

138
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:29,504
<i>2... 1.</i>

139
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:38,862
I told you,
S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't negotiate.

140
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:43,978
The line just went dead.

141
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:45,704
I've lost contact with them...

142
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,053
Ahh!

143
00:10:59,253 --> 00:11:01,381
Hostages en route to extraction.

144
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:04,699
<i>Romanoff missed
the rendezvous point, Cap.</i>

145
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:07,221
<i>Hostiles are still in play.</i>

146
00:11:07,373 --> 00:11:09,740
Natasha, Batroc's on the move.

147
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:11,981
Circle back to Rumlow
and protect the hostages.

148
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:14,019
Natasha.

149
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:52,333
I thought you were
more than just a shield...

150
00:12:06,453 --> 00:12:07,943
Let's see.

151
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:35,258
Well, this is awkward.

152
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:39,899
What are you doing?

153
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:41,348
Backing up the hard drive.

154
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:42,784
It's a good habit to get into.

155
00:12:43,293 --> 00:12:44,340
Rumlow needed your help.

156
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:45,773
What the hell are you doing here?

157
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,539
You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.

158
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:51,984
Whatever I can get my hands on.

159
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:53,498
Our mission is to rescue hostages.

160
00:12:53,613 --> 00:12:55,456
No, that's your mission,

161
00:12:57,293 --> 00:12:58,533
and you've done it beautifully.

162
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:01,217
You just jeopardised
this whole operation.

163
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,778
I think that's overstating things.

164
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:21,899
Okay.

165
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:23,819
That one's on me.

166
00:13:24,853 --> 00:13:26,218
You're damn right.

167
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:57,188
You just can't stop yourself
from lying, can you?

168
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:58,308
I didn't lie.

169
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,698
Agent Romanoff
had a different mission than yours.

170
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:01,657
Which you didn't feel obliged to share.

171
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:03,423
I'm not obliged to do anything.

172
00:14:03,573 --> 00:14:05,053
Those hostages could have died, Nick.

173
00:14:05,213 --> 00:14:08,774
I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.

174
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,173
Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.

175
00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:12,897
Not a bunch of guys
running around shooting guns.

176
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:16,302
Last time I trusted someone,
I lost an eye.

177
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:20,695
Look, I didn't want you doing
anything you weren't comfortable with.

178
00:14:20,853 --> 00:14:22,981
Agent Romanoff is comfortable
with everything.

179
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:24,334
I can't lead a mission

180
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:26,262
when the people I'm leading
have missions of their own.

181
00:14:26,453 --> 00:14:29,104
It's called compartmentalisation.

182
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:31,978
Nobody spills the secrets,
because nobody knows them all.

183
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:33,900
Except you.

184
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:39,138
You're wrong about me.

185
00:14:39,973 --> 00:14:41,213
I do share.

186
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:43,983
I'm nice like that.

187
00:14:45,893 --> 00:14:46,988
Insight bay.

188
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:48,094
<i>Captain Rogers does not have</i>

189
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,533
<i>clearance for Project Insight.</i>

190
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:52,173
Director override. Fury, Nicholas J.

191
00:14:52,293 --> 00:14:53,863
<i>Confirmed.</i>

192
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:58,296
You know, they used to play music.

193
00:14:58,973 --> 00:14:59,974
Yeah.

194
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:03,694
My grandfather operated one
of these things for 40 years.

195
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:06,220
Granddad worked in a nice building.

196
00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:07,619
Got good tips.

197
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:12,298
He'd walk home every night,
a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

198
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:13,824
He'd say, "Hi."

199
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:15,896
People would say, "Hi" back.

200
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:19,148
Time went on,
the neighbourhood got rougher.

201
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:20,174
He'd say, "Hi."

202
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,742
They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

203
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:25,173
Granddad got to gripping that
lunch bag a little tighter.

204
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:26,974
Did he ever get mugged?

205
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:31,937
Every week some punk would say,
"What's in the bag?"

206
00:15:32,173 --> 00:15:33,823
What would he do?

207
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:35,174
He'd show them.

208
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:39,215
Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded .22 Magnum.

209
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:45,057
Yeah, Granddad loved people.

210
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,300
But he didn't trust them very much.

211
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:55,822
Yeah, I know.

212
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:58,334
They're a little bit bigger than a .22.

213
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:35,094
This is Project Insight.

214
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:37,455
Three next-generation helicarriers

215
00:16:37,693 --> 00:16:40,344
synced to a network
of targeting satellites.

216
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:42,302
<i>Launched from the Lemurian Star.</i>

217
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:45,503
Once we get them in the air,
they never need to come down.

218
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:50,580
Continuous sub-orbital flight,
courtesy of our new repulsor engines.

219
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:52,108
Stark?

220
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:53,428
He had a few suggestions

221
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:55,774
once he got an up-close look
at our old turbines.

222
00:16:56,653 --> 00:16:59,099
These new long-range precision guns

223
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:01,699
can eliminate 1,000 hostiles a minute.

224
00:17:01,893 --> 00:17:06,103
The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.

225
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:09,383
We're gonna neutralise a lot of threats
before they even happen.

226
00:17:09,573 --> 00:17:11,628
Thought the punishment
usually came after the crime.

227
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:13,098
We can't afford to wait that long.

228
00:17:13,253 --> 00:17:14,778
Who's "we"?

229
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:17,214
After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council

230
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:19,700
we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis.

231
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,780
For once, we're way ahead of the curve.

232
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:26,457
By holding a gun to everyone on Earth
and calling it protection.

233
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:30,101
You know, I read those SSR files.

234
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:31,974
"Greatest Generation"?

235
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:34,383
You guys did some nasty stuff.

236
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:36,098
Yeah, we compromised.

237
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:38,533
Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

238
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,220
But we did it
so that people could be free.

239
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:43,620
This isn't freedom. This is fear.

240
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:47,175
S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is,
not as we'd like it to be.

241
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:51,344
And it's getting damn near past time
for you to get with that Programme, Cap.

242
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,176
Don't hold your breath.

243
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:14,821

<i>Steven Rogers was chosen

<i>Captain America</i>

<i>taking down HYDRA,
the Nazi rogue science division.</i>

259
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:26,095
<i>Best friends since childhood,</i>

260
00:19:27,053 --> 00:19:30,375
<i>Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers

<i>in service of his country.</i>

264
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:47,468
<i>That was a difficult winter.</i>

265
00:19:47,493 --> 00:19:50,975
<i>A blizzard had trapped half
our battalion behind the German line.</i>

<i>Steve, Captain Rogers,</i>

<i>he fought his way

268

<i>that had pinned our allies
down for months.</i>

269
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,778

<i>Including the man who would...</i>

271
00:20:07,653 --> 00:20:10,623
<i>Who would become my husband,

<i>Even after he died,
Steve was still changing my life.</i>

273
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:18,813
You should be
proud of yourself, Peggy.

274
00:20:24,813 --> 00:20:26,178
Mmm.

275
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:29,301
I have lived a life.

276
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:34,422
My only regret is that
you didn't get to live yours.

277
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:38,660
What is it?

278
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:44,901
For as long as I can remember,
I just wanted to do what was right.

279
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,654
I guess I'm not quite sure
what that is any more.

280
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:55,948
And I thought I could
throw myself back in and follow orders.

281
00:20:55,973 --> 00:20:57,463
Serve.

282
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:02,695
It's just not the same.

283
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:04,697
You're always so dramatic.

284
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,540
Look, you saved the world.

285
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:17,859
We rather mucked it up.

286
00:21:18,213 --> 00:21:19,499
You didn't.

287
00:21:20,053 --> 00:21:23,774
Knowing that you helped found
S.H.I.E.L.D. is half the reason I stay.

288
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:25,660
Hey.

289
00:21:28,493 --> 00:21:32,737
The world has changed,
and none of us can go back.

290
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:36,095
All we can do is our best.

291
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:40,537
And sometimes the best that
we can do is to start over.

292
00:21:48,013 --> 00:21:49,014

You're alive.

296
00:22:01,693 --> 00:22:04,458
You came back.

297
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:05,734
Yeah, Peggy.

298
00:22:09,253 --> 00:22:11,494
It's been so long.

299
00:22:14,053 --> 00:22:15,543
So long.

300
00:22:16,573 --> 00:22:19,099
Well, I couldn't leave my best girl.

Considering this attack took place

one mile from my country's

318
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:24,694
it's a bit more than that.
I move for immediate hearing.

319

We don't need hearings,
we need action.

320

A breach like this
raises serious questions.

322
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,137

manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:39,495
For the record, Councilman,
he's Algerian.

325
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:42,135
I can draw a map if it'd help.

326
00:23:42,293 --> 00:23:45,137
I appreciate your wit, Secretary Pierce.

327
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:48,897
But this Council takes things
like international piracy fairly seriously.

328
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:52,342
Really? I don't.

329
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:56,344
I don't care about one boat,
I care about the fleet.

330
00:23:57,453 --> 00:24:00,308
If this Council is going to fall to rancour

331
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:03,018
every time someone pushes us
on the playing field,

332
00:24:04,253 --> 00:24:06,301
maybe we need someone to oversee us.

333
00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:09,019
Mr. Secretary,
nobody is suggesting...

334
00:24:13,093 --> 00:24:14,188
Excuse me.

335
00:24:14,213 --> 00:24:15,817
More trouble, Mr. Secretary?

336
00:24:16,013 --> 00:24:17,617
Depends on your definition.

337
00:24:26,373 --> 00:24:29,456
I work 40 floors away
and it takes a hijacking for you to visit?

338
00:24:29,653 --> 00:24:31,735
A nuclear war would do it, too.

339
00:24:32,893 --> 00:24:34,179
You busy in there?

340
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:35,863
Nothing some earmarks can't fix.

341
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:41,175
I'm here to ask a favour.

342
00:24:41,973 --> 00:24:43,816
I want you to call for a vote.

343
00:24:44,053 --> 00:24:46,135
Project Insight has to be delayed.

344
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:48,695
Nick, that's not a favour,

345
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:50,423
that's a sub-committee hearing.
A long one.

346
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:52,333
It could be nothing.
It probably is nothing.

347
00:24:52,453 --> 00:24:55,104
I just need time
to make sure it's nothing.

348
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,340
But if it's something?

349
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:59,343
Then we'll both be damn glad
those helicarriers aren't in the air.

350
00:25:01,493 --> 00:25:02,415
Fine.

351
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:06,700
But you got to get Iron Man
to stop by my niece's birthday party.

352
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,504
Thank you, sir.

353
00:25:08,693 --> 00:25:11,583
And not just a flyby. He's got to mingle.

354
00:25:14,253 --> 00:25:15,414
<i>The thing is,</i>

355
00:25:16,013 --> 00:25:17,981
I think it's getting worse.

356
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:21,540
A cop pulled me over last week.

357
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:23,019
He thought I was drunk.

358
00:25:24,173 --> 00:25:27,655
I swerved to miss a plastic bag.

359
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:30,902
I thought it was an IED.

360
00:25:33,173 --> 00:25:35,062
Some stuff you leave there.

361
00:25:35,373 --> 00:25:37,421
Other stuff you bring back.

362
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:40,503
It's our job to figure out how to carry it.

363
00:25:40,733 --> 00:25:44,897
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase,
or in a little man-purse?

364
00:25:46,053 --> 00:25:47,100
It's up to you.

365
00:25:48,293 --> 00:25:49,813
- I'll see you next week.
- Definitely.

366
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:53,980
Look who it is, the running man.

367
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,299
Caught the last few minutes.
It's pretty intense.

368
00:25:57,493 --> 00:26:00,463
Yeah, brother,
we all got the same problems.

369
00:26:01,173 --> 00:26:02,379
Guilt,

370
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:04,053
regret.

371
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:06,183
You lose someone?

372
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:09,214
My wingman, Riley.

373
00:26:10,213 --> 00:26:11,294
Flying a night mission.

374
00:26:11,453 --> 00:26:13,820
Standard PJ rescue Op.

375
00:26:14,013 --> 00:26:16,061
Nothing we hadn't done
1,000 times before.

376
00:26:16,253 --> 00:26:19,860
Until an RPG knocked Riley's
dumb ass out of the sky.

377
00:26:21,973 --> 00:26:23,304
Nothing I could do.

378
00:26:23,893 --> 00:26:25,895
It's like I was up there just to watch.

379
00:26:27,013 --> 00:26:28,981
- I'm sorry.
- After that,

380
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:32,774
I had a really hard time finding a reason
for being over there, you know?

381
00:26:34,733 --> 00:26:36,974
But you're happy now,
back in the world?

382
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:41,454
The number of people giving me
orders is down to about zero.

383
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:42,654
So, hell yeah.

384
00:26:43,773 --> 00:26:45,173
Are you thinking about getting out?

385
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:46,814
No.

386
00:26:48,853 --> 00:26:50,014
I don't know.

387
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:54,104
To be honest, I don't know
what I would do with myself if I did.

388
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,813
Ultimate fighting?

389
00:26:56,453 --> 00:26:58,854
Just a great idea off the top of my head.

390
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:01,414
Seriously, you could do
whatever you want to do.

391
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:03,460
What makes you happy?

392
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,057
I don't know.

You have 3. Over.

401
00:27:42,413 --> 00:27:44,097

Hi.

439
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,814
I got to go, though.

440
00:33:44,613 --> 00:33:45,819
Okay. Bye.

441
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:48,617
My aunt, she's kind of an insomniac.

442
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:51,374
Yeah.

443
00:33:53,013 --> 00:33:54,060
Hey, if you want...

444
00:33:54,253 --> 00:33:56,415
If you want,
you're welcome to use my machine.

445
00:33:56,653 --> 00:33:58,453
Might be cheaper
than the one in the basement.

Oh, yeah? What's it cost?

447
00:34:01,453 --> 00:34:03,182
A cup of coffee?

448
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:07,624
Thank you, but

449
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:09,857
I already have a load in downstairs,

450
00:34:10,053 --> 00:34:12,897
and you really don't want
my scrubs in your machine.

451
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:16,097
I just finished a rotation
in the infectious disease ward, so...

452
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,301
Well, I'll keep my distance.

453
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:19,619
Hopefully, not too far.

454
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:24,333
Oh, and I think you left your stereo on.

455
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:25,748
Oh.

456
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,263
Right. Thank you.

457
00:34:27,453 --> 00:34:28,454
Yeah.

458
00:35:14,253 --> 00:35:16,017
I don't remember giving you a key.

459
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:20,015
You really think I'd need one?

460
00:35:22,013 --> 00:35:23,663
My wife kicked me out.

461
00:35:25,213 --> 00:35:26,499
I didn't know you were married.

462
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:30,175
A lot of things you don't know about me.

463
00:35:30,933 --> 00:35:32,856
I know, Nick. That's the problem.

464
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:51,015
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but I had no place else to crash.

465
00:35:58,253 --> 00:35:59,664
Who else knows about your wife?

466
00:36:02,373 --> 00:36:03,499

477
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:48,539

478
00:36:49,773 --> 00:36:50,774
His.

479
00:36:56,093 --> 00:36:57,538
Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive.

480
00:36:57,733 --> 00:36:58,734

481

<i>Do we have a 20 on the shooter?</i>

482
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:02,464
Tell him I'm in pursuit.

483
00:38:02,893 --> 00:38:04,148
Is he gonna make it?

484
00:38:04,173 --> 00:38:05,618
I don't know.

485
00:38:07,253 --> 00:38:08,698
Tell me about the shooter.

486
00:38:08,893 --> 00:38:11,021
He's fast. Strong.

487
00:38:13,973 --> 00:38:15,213
Had a metal arm.

488
00:38:20,573 --> 00:38:21,813
Ballistics?

489
00:38:22,453 --> 00:38:25,900
Three slugs, no rifling.
Completely untraceable.

490
00:38:26,093 --> 00:38:27,379
Soviet-made.

491
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:29,374
Yeah.

492
00:38:30,453 --> 00:38:31,588
He's in V-tach.

493
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:32,668
Crash cart coming in.

494
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:33,708
Nurse, help me with the drape.

495
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:35,653
BP's dropping.
Defibrillator!

496
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:39,138
I want you to charge him at 100.

497
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:40,698
Don't do this to me, Nick.

498
00:38:40,933 --> 00:38:42,173
Stand back.

499
00:38:42,413 --> 00:38:43,539
Three, two,

500
00:38:43,893 --> 00:38:45,463
one. Clear.

501
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:48,548
Pulse?
No pulse.

502
00:38:48,573 --> 00:38:49,734
Okay, 200, please.

503
00:38:49,853 --> 00:38:50,934
Stand back!

504
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:53,374
Three, two, one. Clear!

505
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:54,580
Get me epinephrine!

506
00:38:55,853 --> 00:38:56,868
Pulse?

507
00:38:56,893 --> 00:38:57,894
Negative.

508
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:02,581
Don't do this to me, Nick.
Don't do this to me.

509
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:23,948
What's the time?

510
00:39:23,973 --> 00:39:25,054
1:03, Doctor.

511
00:39:27,253 --> 00:39:29,938
Time of death, 1:03 a.m.

512
00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:09,017
I need to take him.

513
00:40:22,973 --> 00:40:24,054
Natasha.

514
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:38,940
Natasha!

515
00:40:40,613 --> 00:40:41,853
Why was Fury in your apartment?

516
00:40:43,693 --> 00:40:45,024
I don't know.

517
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:46,773
Cap, they want you back at S.H.I.E.L.D.

518
00:40:47,293 --> 00:40:48,340
Yeah, give me a second.

519
00:40:48,453 --> 00:40:49,454
They want you now.

520
00:40:50,813 --> 00:40:52,144
Okay.

521
00:40:55,293 --> 00:40:57,375
You're a terrible liar.

522
00:41:03,453 --> 00:41:05,103
<i>S.T.R.I.K.E.
team, escort Captain Rogers</i>

523
00:41:05,373 --> 00:41:07,694
<i>back to S. H. I.E. L.D.
immediately for questioning.</i>

524
00:41:07,853 --> 00:41:09,343
I told him.

525
00:41:16,453 --> 00:41:17,818
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

526
00:41:19,573 --> 00:41:20,654
S.T.R.I.K.E., move it out.

527
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:37,540
Captain Rogers.

528
00:41:37,813 --> 00:41:39,053
Neighbour.

529
00:41:41,053 --> 00:41:42,817
Oh. Captain.

530
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:44,254
I'm Alexander Pierce.

531
00:41:44,893 --> 00:41:46,304
Sir, it's an Honour.

532
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:47,613
The honour's mine, Captain.

533
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:50,219
My father served in the 101st.
Come on in.

534
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:54,013
That photo was taken
5 years after Nick and I met,

535
00:41:54,253 --> 00:41:56,620
when I was at State Department
in Bogota.

536
00:41:56,813 --> 00:41:59,293
E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,

537
00:41:59,493 --> 00:42:03,737
and security got me out,
but the rebels took hostages.

538
00:42:04,213 --> 00:42:07,422
Nick was Deputy Chief
of the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,

539
00:42:07,573 --> 00:42:08,904
and he comes to me with a plan.

540
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:11,108
He wants to storm the building
through the sewers.

541
00:42:11,133 --> 00:42:13,898
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

542
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:18,460
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.

543
00:42:18,693 --> 00:42:20,821
They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?

544
00:42:21,013 --> 00:42:22,424
They find it empty.

545
00:42:23,693 --> 00:42:25,536
Nick had ignored my direct order,

546
00:42:25,733 --> 00:42:29,055
and carried out an unauthorised
military operation on foreign soil,

547
00:42:29,773 --> 00:42:31,855
and saved the lives of
a dozen political officers,

548
00:42:32,173 --> 00:42:33,299
including my daughter.

549
00:42:33,453 --> 00:42:35,023
So you gave him a promotion.

550
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:36,778
I've never had any cause to regret it.

551
00:42:39,013 --> 00:42:41,095
Captain, why was Nick
in your apartment last night?

552
00:42:45,173 --> 00:42:46,254
I don't know.

553
00:42:47,493 --> 00:42:48,824
Did you know it was bugged?

554
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,054
I did, because Nick told me.

555
00:42:52,533 --> 00:42:55,013
Did he tell you
he was the one who bugged it?

556
00:43:01,773 --> 00:43:02,979
I want you to see something.

557
00:43:03,933 --> 00:43:05,373
<i>Who hired you, Batroc?</i>

558
00:43:05,493 --> 00:43:06,415
Is that live?

559
00:43:06,813 --> 00:43:10,181
Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

560
00:43:11,293 --> 00:43:12,828
Are you saying he's a suspect?

561
00:43:12,853 --> 00:43:14,503
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

562
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:17,499
No, no.
It's more complicated than that.

563
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:20,259
<i>Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the Lemurian Star.</i>

564
00:43:20,453 --> 00:43:23,935
And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,

565
00:43:24,653 --> 00:43:28,544
and then the money was run through
17 fictitious accounts.

566
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,016
The last one going to
a holding company

567
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:33,380
that was registered to a Jacob Veech.

568
00:43:33,573 --> 00:43:34,933
Am I supposed to know who that is?

569
00:43:35,093 --> 00:43:37,095
Not likely. Veech died 6 years ago.

570
00:43:37,493 --> 00:43:40,224
His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.

571
00:43:40,973 --> 00:43:44,261
When I first met Nick,
his mother lived at 1437.

572
00:43:45,933 --> 00:43:49,221
Are you saying
Fury hired the pirates? Why?

573
00:43:49,733 --> 00:43:51,417
The prevailing theory

574
00:43:52,493 --> 00:43:55,303
was that the hijacking was
a cover for the acquisition

575
00:43:55,493 --> 00:43:57,860
and sale of classified intelligence.

576
00:43:59,693 --> 00:44:02,503
The sale went sour
and that led to Nick's death.

577
00:44:05,653 --> 00:44:08,418
If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.

578
00:44:09,653 --> 00:44:11,735
Why do you think we're talking?

579
00:44:15,373 --> 00:44:17,944
See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,

580
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:21,899
but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.

581
00:44:23,373 --> 00:44:27,697
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

582
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:30,900
to build a really better world

583
00:44:31,613 --> 00:44:34,776
sometimes means having
to tear the old one down.

584
00:44:37,013 --> 00:44:38,458
And that makes enemies.

585
00:44:40,733 --> 00:44:43,623
Those people that call you dirty
because you got the guts

586
00:44:43,813 --> 00:44:46,578
to stick your hands in the mud
and try to build something better.

587
00:44:47,973 --> 00:44:50,658
And the idea that those people
could be happy today

588
00:44:52,133 --> 00:44:54,579
makes me really, really angry.

589
00:44:58,653 --> 00:45:00,908
Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.

590
00:45:00,933 --> 00:45:02,935
I don't think that's an accident.

591
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:05,097
And I don't think you do, either.

592
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:09,142
So, I'm gonna ask again.

593
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:11,342
Why was he there?

594
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,574
He told me not to trust anyone.

595
00:45:18,813 --> 00:45:21,020
I wonder if that included him.

596
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:27,139
I'm sorry.

597
00:45:27,293 --> 00:45:28,579
Those were his last words.

598
00:45:30,213 --> 00:45:31,419
Excuse me.

599
00:45:34,853 --> 00:45:36,298
Captain,

600
00:45:36,493 --> 00:45:39,497
somebody murdered my friend
and I'm gonna find out why.

601
00:45:40,533 --> 00:45:42,979
Anyone gets in my way,
they're gonna regret it.

602
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:45,744
Anyone.

603
00:45:48,653 --> 00:45:50,098

You want me to get the Tac team ready?

No, let's wait and see what it is first.

614
00:46:35,853 --> 00:46:36,934
Right.

615

I'm sorry about
what happened with Fury.

619
00:47:06,053 --> 00:47:08,021
It's messed up, what happened to him.

620
00:47:08,213 --> 00:47:09,544

Whoa, big guy.

627
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:47,618
I just want you to know, Cap,
this isn't personal!

628
00:48:59,373 --> 00:49:00,499
It kind of feels personal.

629
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:11,495
Drop the shield
and put your hands in the air!

630
00:49:28,213 --> 00:49:30,693
Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open!

631
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,538
You have nowhere to go!

632
00:49:52,373 --> 00:49:53,508
Are you kidding me?

633
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:55,695

a manhunt for Captain America
we deserve to know why.

651
00:51:20,813 --> 00:51:22,178
Because he lied to us.

652
00:51:23,813 --> 00:51:27,295
Captain Rogers has information
regarding the death of Director Fury.

653
00:51:27,853 --> 00:51:29,457
He refused to share it.

654
00:51:30,493 --> 00:51:32,621
As difficult as this is to accept,

655
00:51:33,693 --> 00:51:36,981
Captain America is a fugitive
from S.H.I.E.L.D.

656
00:52:04,573 --> 00:52:05,620
- Where is it?
- Safe.

657
00:52:05,773 --> 00:52:07,377
- Do better.
- Where did you get it?

658
00:52:07,613 --> 00:52:08,853
Why would I tell you?

659
00:52:09,053 --> 00:52:11,101
Fury gave it to you. Why?

660
00:52:11,293 --> 00:52:12,704
- What's on it?
- I don't know.

661
00:52:12,893 --> 00:52:13,894
Stop lying.

662
00:52:14,093 --> 00:52:15,733
I only act like
I know everything, Rogers.

663
00:52:17,013 --> 00:52:18,973
I bet you knew Fury hired
the pirates, didn't you?

664
00:52:20,013 --> 00:52:22,937
Well, it makes sense. The ship was
dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.

665
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,379
I'm not gonna ask you again.

666
00:52:26,253 --> 00:52:27,459
I know who killed Fury.

667
00:52:31,413 --> 00:52:33,893
Most of the intelligence community
doesn't believe he exists.

668
00:52:34,093 --> 00:52:36,937
The ones that do
call him the Winter Soldier.

669
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:39,135
He's credited with over
two dozen assassinations

670
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:41,222
in the last 50 years.

671
00:52:41,693 --> 00:52:43,218
So he's a ghost story.

672
00:52:43,573 --> 00:52:46,656
5 years ago, I was escorting
a nuclear engineer out of Iran.

673
00:52:46,853 --> 00:52:49,140
Somebody shot out
my tyres near Odessa.

674
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,620
We lost control,
went straight over a cliff.

675
00:52:51,813 --> 00:52:53,099
I pulled us out.

676
00:52:53,293 --> 00:52:55,182
But the Winter Soldier was there.

677
00:52:55,933 --> 00:52:58,220
I was covering my engineer
so he shot him

678
00:52:58,573 --> 00:52:59,574
straight through me.

679
00:53:00,413 --> 00:53:01,494
Soviet slug.

680
00:53:02,093 --> 00:53:04,699
No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis.

681
00:53:06,213 --> 00:53:08,102
Yeah, I bet you look terrible
in them now.

682
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:13,339
Going after him is a dead end.
I know, I've tried.

683
00:53:14,693 --> 00:53:16,741
Like you said, he's a ghost story.

684
00:53:21,613 --> 00:53:23,502
Well, let's find out
what the ghost wants.

685
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,861
<i>Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood.</i>

686
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:27,828
To any reasonable person,

687
00:53:27,853 --> 00:53:30,459
that would make him a martyr,
not a traitor.

688
00:53:30,573 --> 00:53:31,938
You know what makes him a traitor?

689
00:53:32,093 --> 00:53:34,460
Hiring a mercenary
to hijack his own ship.

690
00:53:34,613 --> 00:53:36,934
Nick Fury used your friendship

691
00:53:37,093 --> 00:53:40,142
to coerce this Council
into delaying Project Insight.

692
00:53:40,373 --> 00:53:42,654
A project he knew would expose
his own illegal operations.

693
00:53:42,973 --> 00:53:45,863
At best, he lied to you. At worst...

694
00:53:46,053 --> 00:53:48,374
Are you calling for my resignation?

695
00:53:48,573 --> 00:53:50,013
I've got a pen and paper right here.

696
00:53:50,173 --> 00:53:52,699
That discussion can be tabled
for a later time.

697
00:53:53,893 --> 00:53:55,463
But you do want to have a discussion?

698
00:53:55,613 --> 00:53:57,536
We've already had it, Mr. Secretary.

699
00:53:58,613 --> 00:54:03,016
This Council moves to
immediately reactivate Project Insight.

700
00:54:04,293 --> 00:54:07,661
If you want to say something snappy,
now would be a good time.

701
00:54:13,773 --> 00:54:17,061
First rule of going on the run
is don't run, walk.

702
00:54:17,813 --> 00:54:20,134
If I run in these shoes,
they're gonna fall off.

703
00:54:23,173 --> 00:54:25,788
The drive has a Level 6 homing
program, so as soon as we boot up

704
00:54:25,813 --> 00:54:27,748
S.H.I.E.L.D. will know
exactly where we are.

705
00:54:27,773 --> 00:54:28,853
How much time will we have?

706
00:54:29,293 --> 00:54:31,500
About 9 minutes from

707
00:54:33,133 --> 00:54:34,180
now.

708
00:54:39,493 --> 00:54:41,143
Fury was right about that ship.

709
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:43,415
Somebody's trying to hide something.

710
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,581
This drive is protected
by some sort of AI.

711
00:54:45,813 --> 00:54:48,180
It keeps rewriting itself
to counter my commands.

712
00:54:48,373 --> 00:54:50,023
Can you override it?

713
00:54:50,773 --> 00:54:53,054
The person who developed this
is slightly smarter than me.

714
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,534
Slightly.

715
00:55:05,373 --> 00:55:06,613
I'm gonna try running a tracer.

716
00:55:07,693 --> 00:55:09,468
This is a program
that S.H.I.E.L.D. developed

717
00:55:09,493 --> 00:55:10,858
to track hostile malware,

718
00:55:11,013 --> 00:55:13,823
so if we can't read the file,

719
00:55:14,053 --> 00:55:15,653
maybe we can find out
where it came from.

720
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:17,573
Can I help you guys with anything?

721
00:55:18,013 --> 00:55:21,574
Oh, no. My fiance was just helping me
with some honeymoon destinations.

722
00:55:21,773 --> 00:55:23,696
Right. We're getting married.

723
00:55:23,933 --> 00:55:26,173
Congratulations. Where are
you guys thinking about going?

724
00:55:27,733 --> 00:55:29,223
- New Jersey.
- Oh.

725
00:55:34,173 --> 00:55:35,823
I have the exact same glasses.

726
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:38,383
Wow, you two are practically twins.

727
00:55:38,653 --> 00:55:40,064
Yeah, I wish.

728
00:55:40,573 --> 00:55:41,574
Specimen.

729
00:55:42,253 --> 00:55:44,388
If you guys need anything,
I've been Aaron.

730
00:55:44,413 --> 00:55:45,414
Thank you.

731
00:55:47,893 --> 00:55:50,260
- You said 9 minutes. Come on.
- Relax.

732
00:55:51,493 --> 00:55:52,574
Got it.

733
00:55:56,733 --> 00:55:57,868
You know it?

734
00:55:57,893 --> 00:55:59,463
I used to. Let's go.

735
00:56:01,613 --> 00:56:02,853
Standard Tac team.

736
00:56:03,053 --> 00:56:04,384
Two behind, two across,

737
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:06,177
and two coming straight at us.

738
00:56:06,373 --> 00:56:09,228
If they make us, I'll engage,
you hit the south escalator to the metro.

739
00:56:09,253 --> 00:56:11,221
Shut up and put your arm around me.
Laugh at something I said.

740
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:12,653
- What?
- Do it.

741
00:56:20,933 --> 00:56:21,934
Negative at the source.

742
00:56:22,093 --> 00:56:23,094
Give me a floor rundown.

743
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:24,853
<i>Negative on three.</i>

744
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,333
<i>Negative on two.</i>

745
00:56:26,533 --> 00:56:28,774
Snake the upper levels.
Work down to me.

746
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:37,780
- Kiss me.
- What?

747
00:56:38,013 --> 00:56:40,015
Public displays of affection
make people very uncomfortable.

748
00:56:40,213 --> 00:56:41,339
Yes, they do.

749
00:56:50,813 --> 00:56:52,383
You still uncomfortable?

750
00:56:53,293 --> 00:56:54,818
It's not exactly the word I would use.

751
00:57:03,933 --> 00:57:06,061
Where did Captain America
learn how to steal a car?

752
00:57:07,013 --> 00:57:08,583
- Nazi Germany.
- Mmm.

753
00:57:08,973 --> 00:57:11,021
And we're borrowing.
Take your feet off the dash.

754
00:57:15,293 --> 00:57:18,820
All right, I have a question for you,
which you do not have to answer.

755
00:57:19,053 --> 00:57:20,468
I feel like, if you don't answer it though,

756
00:57:20,493 --> 00:57:21,824
- you're kind of answering it, you know.
- What?

757
00:57:22,053 --> 00:57:24,533
Was that your first kiss since 1945?

758
00:57:25,053 --> 00:57:26,498
- That bad, huh?
- I didn't say that.

759
00:57:26,653 --> 00:57:28,257
Well, it kind of sounds like
that's what you're saying.

760
00:57:28,373 --> 00:57:29,508
No, I didn't.

761
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:31,456
I just wondered
how much practice you've had.

762
00:57:31,653 --> 00:57:33,303
- You don't need practice.
- Everybody needs practice.

763
00:57:33,493 --> 00:57:35,734
It was not my first kiss since 1945.

764
00:57:36,133 --> 00:57:37,862
I'm 95, I'm not dead.

765
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,988
Nobody special, though?

766
00:57:42,173 --> 00:57:43,308
Believe it or not, it's kind of hard

767
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:45,708
to find someone with
shared life experience.

768
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:47,748
Well, that's all right.
You just make something up.

769
00:57:47,773 --> 00:57:49,696
- What, like you?
- I don't know.

770
00:57:49,893 --> 00:57:51,019
The truth is a matter of circumstance.

771
00:57:51,173 --> 00:57:53,540
It's not all things to all people,
all the time.

772
00:57:54,853 --> 00:57:55,854
Neither am I.

773
00:57:56,613 --> 00:57:57,853
That's a tough way to live.

774
00:57:59,093 --> 00:58:01,175
It's a good way not to die, though.

775
00:58:02,053 --> 00:58:03,498
You know, it's kind of hard
to trust someone,

776
00:58:03,693 --> 00:58:05,533
when you don't know
who that someone really is.

777
00:58:06,253 --> 00:58:07,334
Yeah.

778
00:58:10,533 --> 00:58:11,614
Who do you want me to be?

779
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:13,574
How about a friend?

780
00:58:17,053 --> 00:58:21,138
Well, there's a chance you might be
in the wrong business, Rogers.

781
00:58:36,893 --> 00:58:38,304
This is it.

782
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:41,456
The file came from these coordinates.

783
00:58:42,733 --> 00:58:43,939
So did I.

784
00:58:52,133 --> 00:58:53,578
This camp is where I was trained.

785
00:58:56,613 --> 00:58:57,774
Change much?

786
00:59:00,413 --> 00:59:01,653
A little.

787
00:59:01,853 --> 00:59:03,981
Pick up the pace, ladies!

788
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:05,777
Let's go! Let's go!

789
00:59:06,613 --> 00:59:07,853
Double time!

790
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:11,135
Come on, Rogers, move it!

791
00:59:15,173 --> 00:59:16,504
Come on, fall in!

792
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:18,614
Rogers!

793
00:59:19,053 --> 00:59:20,293
I said fall in!

794
00:59:22,613 --> 00:59:23,774
This is a dead end.

795
00:59:23,933 --> 00:59:26,743
Zero heat signatures,
zero waves, not even radio.

796
00:59:28,173 --> 00:59:31,017
Whoever wrote the file must
have used a router to throw people off.

797
00:59:32,973 --> 00:59:33,974
What is it?

798
00:59:34,173 --> 00:59:36,148
Army regulations
forbid storing munitions

799
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:38,096
within 500 yards of the barracks.

800
00:59:38,893 --> 00:59:40,941
This building is in the wrong place.

801
00:59:56,333 --> 00:59:58,142
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

802
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:00,936
Maybe where it started.

803
01:00:19,013 --> 01:00:20,742
And there's Stark's father.

804
01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:22,698
Howard.

805
01:00:24,013 --> 01:00:25,253
Who's the girl?

806
01:00:44,653 --> 01:00:46,974
If you're already working
in a secret office,

807
01:00:57,533 --> 01:00:59,188
why do you need to hide the elevator?

808
01:01:50,853 --> 01:01:54,619
This can't be the data point.
This technology is ancient.

809
01:02:24,573 --> 01:02:26,575
Y-E-S spells yes.

810
01:02:30,653 --> 01:02:32,576
Shall we play a game?

811
01:02:33,173 --> 01:02:35,574
- It's from a movie that was really...
- I know, I saw it.

812
01:02:41,813 --> 01:02:43,781
<i>Rogers, Steven,</i>

813
01:02:44,813 --> 01:02:46,497
<i>born 1918.</i>

814
01:02:49,653 --> 01:02:52,384
<i>Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna,</i>

815
01:02:52,573 --> 01:02:54,416
<i>born 1984.</i>

816
01:02:54,613 --> 01:02:55,978
It's some kind of recording.

817
01:02:56,173 --> 01:02:58,494
<i>I am not a recording, Fraulein.</i>

818
01:02:59,173 --> 01:03:00,902
<i>I may not be the man I was</i>

819
01:03:01,173 --> 01:03:04,336
<i>when the Captain took me
prisoner in 1945.</i>

820
01:03:04,853 --> 01:03:06,457
<i>But I am.</i>

821
01:03:08,293 --> 01:03:09,738
You know this thing?

822
01:03:13,133 --> 01:03:16,137
Arnim Zola was a German
scientist who worked for the Red Skull.

823
01:03:16,533 --> 01:03:17,580
He's been dead for years.

824
01:03:17,773 --> 01:03:20,060
<i>First correction, I am Swiss.</i>

825
01:03:20,493 --> 01:03:22,860
<i>Second, look around you.</i>

826
01:03:23,013 --> 01:03:25,664
<i>I have never been more alive.</i>

827
01:03:26,173 --> 01:03:30,497
<i>In 1972,
I received a terminal diagnosis.</i>

828
01:03:30,693 --> 01:03:33,458
<i>Science could not save my body.</i>

829
01:03:33,733 --> 01:03:37,863
<i>My mind, however,
that was worth saving,</i>

830
01:03:38,093 --> 01:03:41,859
<i>on 200,000 feet of databanks.</i>

831
01:03:42,053 --> 01:03:45,614
<i>You are standing in my brain.</i>

832
01:03:45,853 --> 01:03:48,060
<i>- How did you get here?
- Invited.</i>

833
01:03:48,693 --> 01:03:50,900
It was Operation Paperclip
after World War II.

834
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:54,734
S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited
German scientists with strategic value.

835
01:03:54,893 --> 01:03:57,055
<i>They thought I could help their cause.</i>

836
01:03:57,213 --> 01:03:59,102
<i>I also helped my own.</i>

837
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,818
HYDRA died with the Red Skull.

838
01:04:01,013 --> 01:04:04,904
<i>Cut off one head,
two more shall take its place.</i>

839
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:06,744
Prove it.

840
01:04:08,093 --> 01:04:10,016
<i>Accessing archive.</i>

841
01:04:10,573 --> 01:04:13,895
<i>HYDRA was founded on
the belief that humanity</i>

842
01:04:14,093 --> 01:04:17,256
<i>could not be trusted
with its own freedom.</i>

843
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:20,138
<i>What we did not realise was
that if you try</i>

844
01:04:20,333 --> 01:04:23,143
<i>to take that freedom, they resist.</i>

845
01:04:24,013 --> 01:04:25,538
<i>The war taught us much.</i>

846
01:04:26,133 --> 01:04:29,421
<i>Humanity needed to surrender
its freedom willingly.</i>

847
01:04:30,573 --> 01:04:33,304
<i>After the war,
S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded,</i>

848
01:04:33,493 --> 01:04:35,621
<i>and I was recruited.</i>

849
01:04:36,053 --> 01:04:38,055
<i>The new HYDRA grew.</i>

850
01:04:38,253 --> 01:04:42,542
<i>A beautiful parasite inside S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

851
01:04:42,933 --> 01:04:44,617
<i>For 70 years,</i>

852
01:04:44,773 --> 01:04:50,416
<i>HYDRA has been secretly
feeding crisis, reaping war,</i>

853
01:04:50,613 --> 01:04:53,298
<i>and when history did not cooperate,</i>

854
01:04:54,133 --> 01:04:55,783
<i>history was changed.</i>

855
01:04:56,133 --> 01:04:58,295
That's impossible.
S.H.I.E.L.D. would have stopped you.

856
01:04:58,413 --> 01:05:00,814
<i>Accidents will happen.</i>

857
01:05:02,813 --> 01:05:05,623
<i>HYDRA created a world so chaotic</i>

858
01:05:05,853 --> 01:05:09,653
<i>that humanity is finally ready
to sacrifice its freedom</i>

859
01:05:10,013 --> 01:05:12,015
<i>to gain its security.</i>

860
01:05:12,813 --> 01:05:16,056
<i>Once a purification process
is complete,</i>

861
01:05:16,613 --> 01:05:19,981
<i>HYDRA'S new world order will arise.</i>

862
01:05:20,893 --> 01:05:22,816
<i>We won, Captain.</i>

863
01:05:22,973 --> 01:05:26,500
<i>Your death amounts to
the same as your life.</i>

864
01:05:26,973 --> 01:05:28,020
<i>A zero sum.</i>

865
01:05:31,653 --> 01:05:33,542
<i>As I was saying...</i>

866
01:05:34,373 --> 01:05:35,420
What's on this drive?

867
01:05:35,653 --> 01:05:38,896
<i>Project Insight requires insight.</i>

868
01:05:39,373 --> 01:05:41,899
<i>So, I wrote an algorithm.</i>

869
01:05:42,293 --> 01:05:43,628
What kind of algorithm?
What does it do?

870
01:05:43,653 --> 01:05:46,179
<i>The answer to your question
is fascinating.</i>

871
01:05:46,613 --> 01:05:50,663
<i>Unfortunately, you shall
be too dead to hear it.</i>

872
01:05:56,493 --> 01:05:57,938
Steve, we got a bogey.

873
01:05:58,373 --> 01:05:59,943
Short range ballistic.

874
01:06:00,253 --> 01:06:01,988
- 30 seconds tops.
- Who fired it?

875
01:06:02,013 --> 01:06:03,014
S.H.I.E.L.D.

876
01:06:03,173 --> 01:06:06,939
<i>I am afraid
I have been stalling, Captain.</i>

877
01:06:07,453 --> 01:06:08,534
<i>Admit it.</i>

878
01:06:08,693 --> 01:06:10,934
<i>It's better this way.</i>

879
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,544
<i>We are, both of us,</i>

880
01:06:13,853 --> 01:06:15,093
<i>out of time.</i>

881
01:07:38,533 --> 01:07:40,058
Call in the asset.

882
01:07:56,293 --> 01:07:57,693
I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce.

883
01:07:58,213 --> 01:08:00,022
You need anything before I leave?

884
01:08:00,813 --> 01:08:04,101
No... Uh, it's fine, Renata,
you can go home.

885
01:08:04,733 --> 01:08:06,417
Okay. Night-night.

886
01:08:06,653 --> 01:08:08,303
Good night.

887
01:08:13,453 --> 01:08:14,818
Want some milk?

888
01:08:24,453 --> 01:08:26,296
The timetable has moved.

889
01:08:28,453 --> 01:08:30,182
Our window is limited.

890
01:08:34,213 --> 01:08:36,341
Two targets, Level Six.

891
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:40,020
They already cost me Zola.

892
01:08:40,213 --> 01:08:42,420
I want confirmed death in 10 hours.

893
01:08:44,373 --> 01:08:46,501
Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I...

894
01:08:47,013 --> 01:08:48,299
I forgot my

895
01:08:48,533 --> 01:08:49,659
phone.

896
01:08:54,693 --> 01:08:57,822
Oh, Renata,
I wish you would have knocked.

897
01:09:22,373 --> 01:09:23,508
Hey, man.

898
01:09:23,533 --> 01:09:27,060
I'm sorry about this.
We need a place to lay low.

899
01:09:27,253 --> 01:09:28,903
Everyone we know is trying to kill us.

900
01:09:31,853 --> 01:09:33,343
Not everyone.

901
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:52,017
- You okay?
- Yeah.

902
01:10:00,933 --> 01:10:02,423
What's going on?

903
01:10:05,693 --> 01:10:09,095
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D.
I thought I was going straight.

904
01:10:12,933 --> 01:10:15,857
But I guess I just traded in
the KGB for HYDRA.

905
01:10:21,733 --> 01:10:23,815
I thought I knew whose lies I was telling,

906
01:10:27,613 --> 01:10:30,378
but I guess I can't tell
the difference any more.

907
01:10:31,413 --> 01:10:33,453
There's a chance you might be
in the wrong business.

908
01:10:38,613 --> 01:10:39,694
I owe you.

909
01:10:41,253 --> 01:10:42,300
It's okay.

910
01:10:42,853 --> 01:10:45,060
If it was the other way around,

911
01:10:46,293 --> 01:10:47,948
and it was down to me to save your life,

912
01:10:47,973 --> 01:10:49,463
now you be honest with me,

913
01:10:51,653 --> 01:10:53,542
would you trust me to do it?

914
01:10:55,693 --> 01:10:56,694
I would now.

915
01:10:59,733 --> 01:11:01,497
And I'm always honest.

916
01:11:02,813 --> 01:11:03,973
Well, you seem pretty chipper

917
01:11:04,133 --> 01:11:06,213
for someone who just found out
they died for nothing.

918
01:11:06,733 --> 01:11:10,419
Well, guess I just like to
know who I'm fighting.

919
01:11:11,293 --> 01:11:12,294
I made breakfast.

920
01:11:12,933 --> 01:11:15,857
If you guys eat that sort of thing.

921
01:11:17,453 --> 01:11:18,818
So, the question is,

922
01:11:19,013 --> 01:11:21,333
who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch
a domestic missile strike?

923
01:11:23,093 --> 01:11:24,094
Pierce.

924
01:11:24,373 --> 01:11:27,024
Who happens to be sitting on top
of the most secure building in the world.

925
01:11:27,173 --> 01:11:28,334
But he's not working alone.

926
01:11:28,533 --> 01:11:30,854
<i>Zola's algorithm
was on the Lemurian Star.</i>

927
01:11:32,013 --> 01:11:33,503
So was Jasper Sitwell.

928
01:11:37,173 --> 01:11:39,494
So, the real question is,
how do the two most wanted people

929
01:11:39,693 --> 01:11:42,617
in Washington kidnap
a S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in broad daylight?

930
01:11:43,453 --> 01:11:45,342
The answer is, you don't.

931
01:11:46,293 --> 01:11:48,022
- What's this?
- Call it a resume.

932
01:11:51,693 --> 01:11:53,263
Is this Bakhmala?

933
01:11:53,453 --> 01:11:55,053
The Khalid Khandil mission,
that was you?

934
01:11:56,613 --> 01:11:58,024
You didn't say he was a Pararescue.

935
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:01,901
- Is this Riley?
- Yeah.

936
01:12:02,093 --> 01:12:04,334
I heard they couldn't bring
in the choppers because of the RPGs.

937
01:12:04,813 --> 01:12:05,828
What did you use? A stealth chute?

938
01:12:05,853 --> 01:12:06,900
No.

939
01:12:07,613 --> 01:12:09,058
These.

940
01:12:13,973 --> 01:12:15,413
I thought you said you were a pilot.

941
01:12:15,573 --> 01:12:16,904
I never said pilot.

942
01:12:20,893 --> 01:12:22,657
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

943
01:12:23,253 --> 01:12:24,698
You got out for a good reason.

944
01:12:24,893 --> 01:12:26,418
Dude, Captain America needs my help.

945
01:12:26,613 --> 01:12:28,213
There's no better reason to get back in.

946
01:12:31,893 --> 01:12:33,577
Where can we get our hands on
one of these things?

947
01:12:33,773 --> 01:12:34,973
The last one is at Fort Meade.

948
01:12:35,933 --> 01:12:38,459
Behind three guarded gates
and a 12-inch steel wall.

949
01:12:41,493 --> 01:12:42,619
Shouldn't be a problem.

950
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:45,937
Listen, I got to fly home tonight

951
01:12:46,133 --> 01:12:48,943
because I got
some constituency problem

952
01:12:49,093 --> 01:12:51,016
and I got to press the flesh.

953
01:12:51,213 --> 01:12:53,500
Any constituent in particular,
Mr. Senator?

954
01:12:54,053 --> 01:12:55,464
Oh, no, not really.

955
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:58,302
23, kind of hot.

956
01:12:58,973 --> 01:13:00,099
Real hot, you know?

957
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:02,455
Wants to be a reporter, I think.
I don't know.

958
01:13:02,653 --> 01:13:03,693
Who listens at that point?

959
01:13:03,853 --> 01:13:05,533
Doesn't sound like
much of a problem to me.

960
01:13:05,693 --> 01:13:07,775
Really? Because she's killing my back.

961
01:13:08,733 --> 01:13:10,497
But this isn't the place to talk about it.

962
01:13:10,693 --> 01:13:11,740
This is a nice pin.

963
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:15,141
- Thank you.
- Come here.

964
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:17,298
Hail HYDRA.

965
01:13:20,453 --> 01:13:22,453
- See, it's right there...
- Yeah, I just saw that.

966
01:13:23,213 --> 01:13:25,093
- Should I get it checked?
- I think you should.

967
01:13:33,493 --> 01:13:34,654
I need a minute.

968
01:13:34,853 --> 01:13:36,503
Bring the car around.

969
01:13:40,133 --> 01:13:41,348
Yes, sir?

970
01:13:41,373 --> 01:13:43,057
<i>Agent Sitwell, how was lunch?</i>

971
01:13:43,253 --> 01:13:45,859
<i>I hear the crab cakes here
are delicious.</i>

972
01:13:45,973 --> 01:13:47,020
Who is this?

973
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:49,858
<i>The good-looking guy in the
sunglasses, your 10 o'clock.</i>

974
01:13:51,973 --> 01:13:53,099
<i>Your other 10 o'clock.</i>

975
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:55,974
<i>There you go.</i>

976
01:13:58,813 --> 01:14:00,338
What do you want?

977
01:14:00,533 --> 01:14:02,413
<i>You're gonna go around
the corner to your right.</i>

978
01:14:02,533 --> 01:14:05,059
There's a grey car two spaces down.

979
01:14:05,253 --> 01:14:07,096
You and I are gonna take a ride.

980
01:14:07,293 --> 01:14:09,022
And why would I do that?

981
01:14:09,173 --> 01:14:11,779
Because that tie looks really expensive,

982
01:14:12,213 --> 01:14:14,181
<i>and I'd hate to mess it up.</i>

983
01:14:23,773 --> 01:14:25,013
Tell me about Zola's algorithm.

984
01:14:26,093 --> 01:14:27,148
Never heard of it.

985
01:14:27,173 --> 01:14:28,268
<i>What were you doing
on the Lemurian Star?</i>

986
01:14:28,293 --> 01:14:30,022
I was throwing up. I get seasick.

987
01:14:35,213 --> 01:14:38,453
Is this little display meant to insinuate
that you're gonna throw me off the roof?

988
01:14:39,533 --> 01:14:41,213
Because it's really not
your style, Rogers.

989
01:14:42,213 --> 01:14:43,214
You're right.

990
01:14:44,093 --> 01:14:45,140
It's not.

991
01:14:45,653 --> 01:14:46,654
It's hers.

992
01:14:50,573 --> 01:14:53,179
Oh, wait. What about that girl
from Accounting, Laura...

993
01:14:53,693 --> 01:14:55,588
Lillian. Lip piercing, right?

994
01:14:55,613 --> 01:14:56,868
Yeah, she's cute.

995
01:14:56,893 --> 01:14:58,383
Yeah. I'm not ready for that.

996
01:15:10,253 --> 01:15:12,335
Zola's algorithm is a program

997
01:15:14,013 --> 01:15:15,094
for choosing

998
01:15:15,333 --> 01:15:16,858
- insight's targets.
- What targets?

999
01:15:17,253 --> 01:15:18,334
You!

1000
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:21,700
A TV anchor in Cairo,
the Under Secretary of Defence,

1001
01:15:21,893 --> 01:15:24,339
a high school Valedictorian in Iowa City,

1002
01:15:24,573 --> 01:15:26,613
Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange,
anyone who's a threat

1003
01:15:26,893 --> 01:15:28,497
to HYDRA.

1004
01:15:28,693 --> 01:15:30,422
Now, or in the future.

1005
01:15:30,733 --> 01:15:32,497
In the future? How could it know?

1006
01:15:36,093 --> 01:15:37,140
How could it not?

1007
01:15:39,253 --> 01:15:42,621
The 21st century is a digital book.

1008
01:15:43,933 --> 01:15:45,776
Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.

1009
01:15:48,693 --> 01:15:49,819
Your bank records,

1010
01:15:50,253 --> 01:15:51,664
medical histories, voting patterns,

1011
01:15:51,853 --> 01:15:54,299
emails, phone calls,
your damn SAT scores!

1012
01:15:55,813 --> 01:15:59,181
Zola's algorithm
evaluates people's past

1013
01:16:00,053 --> 01:16:01,293
to predict their future.

1014
01:16:01,613 --> 01:16:02,660
And what then?

1015
01:16:06,093 --> 01:16:07,857
Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.

1016
01:16:07,973 --> 01:16:09,498
What then?

1017
01:16:12,093 --> 01:16:15,176
Then the Insight helicarriers
scratch people off the list.

1018
01:16:17,413 --> 01:16:19,256
A few million at a time.

1019
01:16:26,893 --> 01:16:27,974
HYDRA doesn't like leaks.

1020
01:16:28,133 --> 01:16:29,893
Then why don't you try
sticking a cork in it?

1021
01:16:30,013 --> 01:16:31,299
Insight's launching in 16 hours.

1022
01:16:31,493 --> 01:16:32,540
We're cutting it a little bit close here.

1023
01:16:32,733 --> 01:16:34,656
I know.
We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans

1024
01:16:34,813 --> 01:16:36,293
and access the helicarriers directly.

1025
01:16:36,453 --> 01:16:37,500
What? Are you crazy?

1026
01:16:38,373 --> 01:16:40,133
That is a terrible, terrible idea.

1027
01:17:23,773 --> 01:17:24,979
Shit!

1028
01:17:36,373 --> 01:17:37,738
Hang on!

1029
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:21,103
I have her. Find him.

1030
01:20:26,373 --> 01:20:27,374
Go! I got this!

1031
01:21:07,413 --> 01:21:09,097
<i>Taking fire above
and below expressway.</i>

1032
01:21:09,253 --> 01:21:11,733
<i>Civilians threatened.
Repeat, civilians threatened.</i>

1033
01:21:15,893 --> 01:21:18,624
<i>I make an LZ,
2300 block of Virginia Avenue.</i>

1034
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:19,854
<i>Rendezvous, 2 minutes.</i>

1035
01:21:45,293 --> 01:21:46,294
Get out of the way!

1036
01:21:46,853 --> 01:21:48,457
Stay out of the way!

1037
01:21:49,933 --> 01:21:51,378
Ahh!

1038
01:23:35,533 --> 01:23:36,580
Bucky?

1039
01:23:37,133 --> 01:23:38,578
Who the hell is Bucky?

1040
01:24:07,253 --> 01:24:08,813
Drop the shield, Cap!
Get on your knees!

1041
01:24:08,933 --> 01:24:10,423
Get on your knees!

1042
01:24:10,613 --> 01:24:13,228
Get down, get down! Get on your knees!

1043
01:24:13,253 --> 01:24:14,414
Down!

1044
01:24:14,933 --> 01:24:15,934
Don't move.

1045
01:24:22,933 --> 01:24:24,219
Put the gun down.

1046
01:24:24,413 --> 01:24:26,336
Not here. Not here!

1047
01:24:41,853 --> 01:24:42,900
<i>It was him.</i>

1048
01:24:46,133 --> 01:24:49,660
He looked right at me
like he didn't even know me.

1049
01:24:50,173 --> 01:24:52,904
How is that even possible?
It was, like, 70 years ago.

1050
01:24:53,093 --> 01:24:54,299
Zola.

1051
01:24:54,493 --> 01:24:56,097
Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43.

1052
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:58,142
Zola experimented on him.

1053
01:24:58,373 --> 01:25:00,660
Whatever he did
helped Bucky survive the fall.

1054
01:25:02,373 --> 01:25:03,708
They must have found him and...

1055
01:25:03,733 --> 01:25:05,656
None of that's your fault, Steve.

1056
01:25:09,293 --> 01:25:11,022
Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.

1057
01:25:14,333 --> 01:25:16,062
We need to get a doctor here.

1058
01:25:16,253 --> 01:25:17,254
If we don't put pressure on that wound,

1059
01:25:17,453 --> 01:25:19,053
she's gonna bleed out here in the truck.

1060
01:25:26,333 --> 01:25:29,496
Ah. That thing was squeezing my brain.

1061
01:25:32,573 --> 01:25:33,654
Who is this guy?

1062
01:25:44,453 --> 01:25:46,421
Three holes. Start digging.

1063
01:26:13,573 --> 01:26:15,496
GSW. She's lost at least a pint.

1064
01:26:15,693 --> 01:26:16,899
Maybe two.

1065
01:26:17,053 --> 01:26:19,055
- Let me take her.
- She'll want to see him first.

1066
01:26:28,973 --> 01:26:31,214
About damn time.

1067
01:26:33,173 --> 01:26:34,777
Lacerated spinal column,

1068
01:26:35,413 --> 01:26:36,788
cracked sternum,

1069
01:26:36,813 --> 01:26:38,417
shattered collarbone,

1070
01:26:38,573 --> 01:26:40,257
perforated liver,

1071
01:26:40,413 --> 01:26:42,177
and one hell of a headache.

1072
01:26:42,413 --> 01:26:43,778
Don't forget your collapsed lung.

1073
01:26:43,973 --> 01:26:45,259
Let's not forget that.

1074
01:26:45,453 --> 01:26:47,103
Otherwise, I'm good.

1075
01:26:47,453 --> 01:26:49,615
They cut you open. Your heart stopped.

1076
01:26:49,813 --> 01:26:51,861
Tetrodotoxin B.

1077
01:26:52,053 --> 01:26:54,021
Slows the pulse to one beat a minute.

1078
01:26:54,213 --> 01:26:56,022
Banner developed it for stress.

1079
01:26:56,213 --> 01:26:58,819
Didn't work so great for him,
but we found a use for it.

1080
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:00,902
Why all the secrecy?
Why not just tell us?

1081
01:27:01,093 --> 01:27:03,380
Any attempt on the Director's
life had to look successful.

1082
01:27:03,853 --> 01:27:06,060
Can't kill you if you're already dead.

1083
01:27:06,413 --> 01:27:07,494
Besides,

1084
01:27:08,773 --> 01:27:10,298
I wasn't sure who to trust.

1085
01:27:25,813 --> 01:27:27,144
Sergeant Barnes.

1086
01:27:29,293 --> 01:27:30,294
Bucky, no!

1087
01:27:34,013 --> 01:27:37,096
<i>The procedure has already started.</i>

1088
01:27:40,973 --> 01:27:44,659
<i>You are to be the new fist of HYDRA.</i>

1089
01:27:45,053 --> 01:27:46,054
<i>Put him on ice.</i>

1090
01:27:57,453 --> 01:27:58,454
Sir.

1091
01:27:59,173 --> 01:28:00,663
He's unstable.

1092
01:28:01,173 --> 01:28:02,584
Erratic.

1093
01:28:15,853 --> 01:28:16,934
Mission report.

1094
01:28:20,453 --> 01:28:21,784
Mission report now.

1095
01:28:34,573 --> 01:28:35,984
The man on the bridge.

1096
01:28:39,133 --> 01:28:40,373
Who was he?

1097
01:28:41,773 --> 01:28:44,060
You met him earlier this week
on another assignment.

1098
01:28:47,133 --> 01:28:48,464
I knew him.

1099
01:28:57,053 --> 01:28:59,738
Your work has been a gift to mankind.

1100
01:29:02,013 --> 01:29:03,424
You shaped the century.

1101
01:29:04,093 --> 01:29:06,573
And I need you to do it one more time.

1102
01:29:07,853 --> 01:29:11,539
Society's at a tipping point
between order and chaos.

1103
01:29:11,733 --> 01:29:14,418
And tomorrow morning,
we're gonna give it a push.

1104
01:29:15,533 --> 01:29:18,742
But, if you don't do your part,
I can't do mine.

1105
01:29:20,413 --> 01:29:23,257
And HYDRA can't give the world
the freedom it deserves.

1106
01:29:26,293 --> 01:29:27,897
But I knew him.

1107
01:29:34,413 --> 01:29:35,938
Prep him.

1108
01:29:36,133 --> 01:29:38,739
He's been out of cryo freeze too long.

1109
01:29:38,933 --> 01:29:40,935
Then wipe him and start over.

1110
01:30:22,653 --> 01:30:26,214
This man declined
the Nobel Peace Prize.

1111
01:30:26,973 --> 01:30:30,216
He said peace wasn't an achievement,

1112
01:30:30,693 --> 01:30:32,775
it was a responsibility.

1113
01:30:33,773 --> 01:30:37,016
See, it's stuff like this
that gives me trust issues.

1114
01:30:37,773 --> 01:30:39,013
We have to stop the launch.

1115
01:30:39,973 --> 01:30:42,738
I don't think the Council's
accepting my calls any more.

1116
01:30:45,253 --> 01:30:46,334
What's that?

1117
01:30:46,693 --> 01:30:49,428
Once the helicarriers reach 3,000 feet,

1118
01:30:49,453 --> 01:30:52,821
they'll triangulate with Insight satellites,
becoming fully weaponised.

1119
01:30:53,493 --> 01:30:55,177
We need to breach those carriers

1120
01:30:55,373 --> 01:30:57,988
and replace their targeting
blades with our own.

1121
01:30:58,013 --> 01:30:59,014
One or two won't cut it.

1122
01:30:59,213 --> 01:31:01,739
We need to link all three
carriers for this to work,

1123
01:31:01,933 --> 01:31:05,255
because if even one of those
ships remains operational,

1124
01:31:05,493 --> 01:31:07,257
a whole lot of people are gonna die.

1125
01:31:07,493 --> 01:31:10,656
We have to assume everyone aboard
those carriers is HYDRA.

1126
01:31:10,973 --> 01:31:13,055
We have to get past them,
insert these server blades.

1127
01:31:13,293 --> 01:31:16,376
And maybe, just maybe
we can salvage what's left...

1128
01:31:16,573 --> 01:31:17,574
We're not salvaging anything.

1129
01:31:17,773 --> 01:31:19,013
We're not just
taking down the carriers, Nick.

1130
01:31:19,253 --> 01:31:20,348
We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.

1131
01:31:20,373 --> 01:31:21,659
S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing to do with this.

1132
01:31:21,853 --> 01:31:24,060
You gave me this mission.
This is how it ends.

1133
01:31:24,173 --> 01:31:26,293
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised.
You said so yourself.

1134
01:31:26,493 --> 01:31:28,222
HYDRA grew right under your nose
and nobody noticed.

1135
01:31:28,373 --> 01:31:31,536
Why do you think we're meeting
in this cave? I noticed.

1136
01:31:31,893 --> 01:31:33,577
How many paid the price
before you did?

1137
01:31:36,613 --> 01:31:38,377
Look, I didn't know about Barnes.

1138
01:31:38,573 --> 01:31:40,453
Even if you had,
would you have told me?

1139
01:31:40,693 --> 01:31:43,378
Or would you have
compartmentalised that, too?

1140
01:31:43,613 --> 01:31:46,378
S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA,

1141
01:31:46,613 --> 01:31:47,899
it all goes.

1142
01:31:48,413 --> 01:31:49,619
He's right.

1143
01:31:55,413 --> 01:31:56,460
Don't look at me.

1144
01:31:56,653 --> 01:31:58,542
I do what he does, just slower.

1145
01:32:02,253 --> 01:32:03,903
Well...

1146
01:32:10,173 --> 01:32:12,574
It looks like you're giving
the orders now, Captain.

1147
01:32:24,213 --> 01:32:25,748
<i>We looked for you, after.</i>

1148
01:32:26,973 --> 01:32:28,975
<i>My folks wanted to give you
a ride to the cemetery.</i>

1149
01:32:29,173 --> 01:32:32,780
I know, I'm sorry.
I just kind of wanted to be alone.

1150
01:32:33,893 --> 01:32:35,304
How was it?

1151
01:32:35,773 --> 01:32:37,263
It was okay.

1152
01:32:37,693 --> 01:32:39,616
She's next to Dad.

1153
01:32:41,093 --> 01:32:42,379
I was gonna ask...

1154
01:32:42,773 --> 01:32:44,533
I know what you're gonna say, Buck.
I just...

1155
01:32:45,413 --> 01:32:46,903
We can put the
couch cushions on the floor

1156
01:32:47,133 --> 01:32:48,623
like when we were kids.

1157
01:32:49,293 --> 01:32:51,773
It'll be fun.
All you got to do is shine my shoes,

1158
01:32:52,213 --> 01:32:53,897
maybe take out the trash.

1159
01:32:58,933 --> 01:33:00,344
Come on.

1160
01:33:03,373 --> 01:33:06,820
Thank you, Buck,
but I can get by on my own.

1161
01:33:07,613 --> 01:33:11,379
The thing is, you don't have to.

1162
01:33:14,733 --> 01:33:16,373
I'm with you to the end of the line, pal.

1163
01:33:19,653 --> 01:33:21,028
He's gonna be there, you know.

1164
01:33:21,053 --> 01:33:22,100
I know.

1165
01:33:22,973 --> 01:33:26,341
Look, whoever he used to be
and the guy he is now,

1166
01:33:26,973 --> 01:33:29,180
I don't think he's the kind you save.

1167
01:33:29,373 --> 01:33:30,818
He's the kind you stop.

1168
01:33:33,493 --> 01:33:35,097
I don't know if I can do that.

1169
01:33:35,413 --> 01:33:37,381
Well, he might not give you a choice.

1170
01:33:37,573 --> 01:33:39,063
He doesn't know you.

1171
01:33:39,773 --> 01:33:40,820
He will.

1172
01:33:43,573 --> 01:33:44,859
Gear up. It's time.

1173
01:33:47,493 --> 01:33:48,619
You gonna wear that?

1174
01:33:48,853 --> 01:33:52,221
No. If you're gonna fight a war,
you got to wear a uniform.

1175
01:34:00,133 --> 01:34:01,578
Oh, man.

1176
01:34:02,373 --> 01:34:04,455
I am so fired.

1177
01:34:29,333 --> 01:34:31,574
<i>We are in final launch sequence.</i>

1178
01:34:33,213 --> 01:34:35,136
We are go on guidance.

1179
01:34:37,053 --> 01:34:39,181
<i>All personnel to launch stations.</i>

1180
01:34:39,933 --> 01:34:41,213
And how was your flight?

1181
01:34:41,333 --> 01:34:42,428
Lovely.

1182
01:34:42,453 --> 01:34:44,933
The ride from the airport, less so.

1183
01:34:45,053 --> 01:34:47,579
Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D. can't
control everything.

1184
01:34:47,733 --> 01:34:49,656
Including Captain America.

1185
01:34:53,093 --> 01:34:55,664
This facility is biometrically controlled.

1186
01:34:55,853 --> 01:34:58,743
And these will give you
unrestricted access.

1187
01:35:02,693 --> 01:35:03,899
I've been parking there for 2 months.

1188
01:35:04,093 --> 01:35:05,697
But it's his spot.
So where's he been?

1189
01:35:05,893 --> 01:35:07,188
I think Afghanistan.

1190
01:35:07,213 --> 01:35:09,215
Negative DT Six. The pattern is full.

1191
01:35:09,413 --> 01:35:10,788
Well, he could've said something.

1192
01:35:10,813 --> 01:35:12,348
Ahh!

1193
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:13,704
Must be the dish.

1194
01:35:15,493 --> 01:35:17,097
I'll check it out.

1195
01:35:17,933 --> 01:35:20,937
<i>Triskelion command
request we clear the area for launch.</i>

1196
01:35:24,613 --> 01:35:25,628
Excuse us.

1197
01:35:25,653 --> 01:35:28,099
<i>I know the road
hasn't exactly been smooth,</i>

1198
01:35:28,613 --> 01:35:31,935
and some of you would have gladly
kicked me out of the car along the way.

1199
01:35:34,213 --> 01:35:35,180
Finally, we're here.

1200
01:35:35,893 --> 01:35:37,816
And the world should be grateful.

1201
01:35:38,773 --> 01:35:40,502
<i>Attention all S.H.I E.L.D. agents,</i>

1202
01:35:40,693 --> 01:35:42,457
<i>this is Steve Rogers.</i>

1203
01:35:44,253 --> 01:35:46,460
<i>You've heard a lot about me
over the last few days.</i>

1204
01:35:47,493 --> 01:35:49,780
<i>Some of you were even ordered
to hunt me down.</i>

1205
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:53,343
But I think it's time you know the truth.

1206
01:35:56,493 --> 01:35:58,655
S.H.I.E.L.D. is not
what we thought it was.

1207
01:35:58,853 --> 01:36:00,582
It's been taken over by HYDRA.

1208
01:36:01,693 --> 01:36:03,377
<i>Alexander Pierce is their leader.</i>

1209
01:36:07,493 --> 01:36:09,814
<i>The S.T.R.I.K.E. and Insight crew
are HYDRA as well.</i>

1210
01:36:10,013 --> 01:36:11,093
<i>I don't know how many more,</i>

1211
01:36:12,373 --> 01:36:13,773
but I know they're in the building.

1212
01:36:15,173 --> 01:36:17,062
<i>They could be standing
right next to you.</i>

1213
01:36:18,613 --> 01:36:20,297
<i>They almost have what they want.</i>

1214
01:36:21,093 --> 01:36:23,175
<i>Absolute control.</i>

1215
01:36:23,653 --> 01:36:25,018
They shot Nick Fury.

1216
01:36:26,133 --> 01:36:27,259
<i>And it won't end there.</i>

1217
01:36:27,813 --> 01:36:30,020
If you launch those helicarriers today,

1218
01:36:30,173 --> 01:36:32,493
<i>HYDRA will be able to kill
anyone that stands in their way.</i>

1219
01:36:35,453 --> 01:36:36,864
<i>Unless we stop them.</i>

1220
01:36:40,853 --> 01:36:41,979
<i>I know I'm asking a lot.</i>

1221
01:36:43,893 --> 01:36:47,056
<i>But the price of freedom is high.
It always has been.</i>

1222
01:36:47,813 --> 01:36:49,702
And it's a price I'm willing to pay.

1223
01:36:52,053 --> 01:36:54,863
And if I'm the only one, then so be it.

1224
01:36:56,533 --> 01:36:58,297
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.

1225
01:37:03,053 --> 01:37:06,341
Did you write that down first,
or was it off the top of your head?

1226
01:37:06,853 --> 01:37:08,457
You smug son of a bitch.

1227
01:37:12,533 --> 01:37:13,614
Arrest him.

1228
01:37:16,453 --> 01:37:18,103
I guess I've got the floor.

1229
01:37:24,973 --> 01:37:27,897
Preempt the launch sequence.
Send those ships up now.

1230
01:37:32,293 --> 01:37:33,828
Is there a problem?

1231
01:37:33,853 --> 01:37:34,854
Um...

1232
01:37:38,813 --> 01:37:39,894
Is there a problem?

1233
01:37:40,093 --> 01:37:41,174
I'm sorry, sir.

1234
01:37:49,893 --> 01:37:52,100
I'm not gonna launch those ships.

1235
01:37:54,813 --> 01:37:56,099
Captain's orders.

1236
01:37:56,293 --> 01:37:57,579
Move away from your station.

1237
01:37:57,933 --> 01:37:58,980
Like he said...

1238
01:37:59,133 --> 01:38:00,228
Hold it right there.

1239
01:38:00,253 --> 01:38:01,618
Put the gun down!

1240
01:38:01,773 --> 01:38:02,774
Captain's orders.

1241
01:38:05,173 --> 01:38:06,618
You picked the wrong side, Agent.

1242
01:38:08,453 --> 01:38:10,057
Depends on where you're standing.

1243
01:38:54,453 --> 01:38:56,013
Close the bay door!

1244
01:38:56,093 --> 01:38:57,333
Close the bay door now!

1245
01:38:57,813 --> 01:38:58,780
Close the bay door!

1246
01:39:18,653 --> 01:39:19,859
They're initiating launch.

1247
01:39:40,053 --> 01:39:42,659
Hey, Cap, how do we know
the good guys from the bad guys?

1248
01:39:42,853 --> 01:39:44,453
If they're shooting at you, they're bad.

1249
01:40:17,693 --> 01:40:18,694
Hey, Cap,

1250
01:40:18,893 --> 01:40:20,948
I found those bad guys
you were talking about.

1251
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:21,974
You okay?

1252
01:40:24,133 --> 01:40:25,658
I'm not dead yet.

1253
01:40:32,613 --> 01:40:34,377
Let me ask you a question.

1254
01:40:36,893 --> 01:40:40,022
What if Pakistan marched
into Mumbai tomorrow

1255
01:40:41,293 --> 01:40:43,493
and you knew that they were
going to drag your daughters

1256
01:40:43,653 --> 01:40:46,418
into a soccer stadium for execution,

1257
01:40:48,853 --> 01:40:52,175
and you could just stop it,
with a flick of the switch.

1258
01:40:52,413 --> 01:40:53,574
Wouldn't you?

1259
01:40:53,773 --> 01:40:55,423
Wouldn't you all?

1260
01:40:57,293 --> 01:40:58,783
Not if it was your switch.

1261
01:41:23,293 --> 01:41:24,499
I'm sorry.

1262
01:41:30,933 --> 01:41:32,503
Did I step on your moment?

1263
01:41:34,053 --> 01:41:36,340
Satellites in range at 3,000 feet.

1264
01:41:37,293 --> 01:41:38,454
Falcon, status?

1265
01:41:38,693 --> 01:41:39,854
Engaging.

1266
01:42:03,973 --> 01:42:05,259
All right, Cap. I'm in.

1267
01:42:07,653 --> 01:42:08,700
Oh, shit.

1268
01:42:39,213 --> 01:42:40,658
<i>8 minutes, Cap.</i>

1269
01:42:41,173 --> 01:42:42,538
Working on it.

1270
01:42:50,893 --> 01:42:51,988
What are you doing?

1271
01:42:52,013 --> 01:42:53,668
She's disabling security protocols

1272
01:42:53,693 --> 01:42:55,493
and dumping all the secrets
onto the Internet.

1273
01:42:55,653 --> 01:42:57,333
- Including HYDRA'S.
- And S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

1274
01:42:58,573 --> 01:42:59,654
If you do this,

1275
01:42:59,893 --> 01:43:01,577
none of your past is
gonna remain hidden.

1276
01:43:04,653 --> 01:43:07,179
Are you sure you're ready
for the world to see you

1277
01:43:07,373 --> 01:43:08,898
as you really are?

1278
01:43:09,653 --> 01:43:11,098
Are you?

1279
01:43:27,333 --> 01:43:28,380
Alpha lock.

1280
01:43:30,493 --> 01:43:31,824
Falcon, where are you now?

1281
01:43:31,973 --> 01:43:32,895
I had to take a detour.

1282
01:44:03,813 --> 01:44:04,814
Whoo!

1283
01:44:05,493 --> 01:44:07,097
Oh, yeah!

1284
01:44:13,093 --> 01:44:14,140
I'm in.

1285
01:44:17,773 --> 01:44:19,616
Bravo lock.

1286
01:44:21,413 --> 01:44:22,699
Two down, one to go.

1287
01:44:24,973 --> 01:44:26,813
All S.H.I.E.L.D. pilots, scramble.

1288
01:44:27,373 --> 01:44:29,979
We're the only air support
Captain Rogers has got.

1289
01:45:12,453 --> 01:45:15,138
Disabling the encryption
is an executive order.

1290
01:45:15,333 --> 01:45:16,983
It takes two Alpha Level members.

1291
01:45:17,213 --> 01:45:19,228
Don't worry. Company's coming.

1292
01:45:42,773 --> 01:45:43,899
Did you get my flowers?

1293
01:45:46,613 --> 01:45:48,453
- I'm glad you're here, Nick.
- Really?

1294
01:45:50,253 --> 01:45:52,096
Because I thought you had me killed.

1295
01:45:52,333 --> 01:45:53,778
You know how the game works.

1296
01:45:54,853 --> 01:45:56,628
So why make me head of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

1297
01:45:56,653 --> 01:45:57,939
Because you were the best,

1298
01:45:58,133 --> 01:45:59,693
and the most ruthless person
I ever met.

1299
01:45:59,893 --> 01:46:02,134
I did what I did to protect people.

1300
01:46:03,053 --> 01:46:05,021
Our enemies are your enemies, Nick.

1301
01:46:05,933 --> 01:46:08,254
Disorder. War.

1302
01:46:09,253 --> 01:46:11,574
It's just a matter of time
before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow,

1303
01:46:11,773 --> 01:46:13,935
or an EMP fries Chicago.

1304
01:46:15,493 --> 01:46:16,938
Diplomacy?

1305
01:46:17,093 --> 01:46:19,414
A holding action, Nick. A band-aid.

1306
01:46:20,333 --> 01:46:23,257
And you know where
I learned that. Bogota.

1307
01:46:25,013 --> 01:46:27,744
You didn't ask.
You just did what had to be done.

1308
01:46:28,933 --> 01:46:33,257
I can bring order to the lives
of seven billion people

1309
01:46:33,933 --> 01:46:35,583
by sacrificing 20 million.

1310
01:46:37,133 --> 01:46:39,101
It's the next step, Nick.

1311
01:46:39,293 --> 01:46:40,419
If you have the courage to take it.

1312
01:46:40,613 --> 01:46:42,695
No. I have the courage not to.

1313
01:46:47,213 --> 01:46:49,148
<i>Retinal scanner active.</i>

1314
01:46:50,573 --> 01:46:52,974
You don't think we've wiped
your clearance from the system?

1315
01:46:53,133 --> 01:46:55,101
I know you erased my password.

1316
01:46:55,293 --> 01:46:57,216
Probably deleted my retinal scan.

1317
01:46:57,773 --> 01:47:00,617
But if you want to stay ahead
of me, Mr. Secretary,

1318
01:47:04,613 --> 01:47:07,583
you need to keep both eyes open.

1319
01:47:11,973 --> 01:47:13,498
<i>Alpha level confirmed.</i>

1320
01:47:13,973 --> 01:47:15,816
<i>Encryption code accepted.</i>

1321
01:47:15,973 --> 01:47:17,179
<i>Safeguards removed.</i>

1322
01:47:17,533 --> 01:47:20,537
Charlie carrier is
45 degrees off the port bow.

1323
01:47:26,253 --> 01:47:27,334
6 minutes.

1324
01:47:27,493 --> 01:47:29,973
Hey, Sam, gonna need a ride.

1325
01:47:30,853 --> 01:47:32,503
Roger. Let me know when you're ready.

1326
01:47:35,133 --> 01:47:36,339
I just did!

1327
01:47:54,093 --> 01:47:56,016
You know, you're a lot heavier
than you look.

1328
01:47:56,213 --> 01:47:57,339
I had a big breakfast.

1329
01:47:59,933 --> 01:48:01,264
Steve!

1330
01:48:31,733 --> 01:48:33,293
<i>Cap! Cap, come in.
Are you okay?</i>

1331
01:48:33,693 --> 01:48:34,979
Yeah, I'm here.

1332
01:48:35,533 --> 01:48:36,693
I'm still on the helicarrier.

1333
01:48:37,613 --> 01:48:39,263
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm grounded.</i>

1334
01:48:39,853 --> 01:48:42,220
The suit's down. Sorry, Cap.

1335
01:48:43,013 --> 01:48:44,902
Don't worry. I got it.

1336
01:48:46,893 --> 01:48:48,588
<i>Emergency evacuation alert.</i>

1337
01:48:48,613 --> 01:48:51,583
<i>All personnel, proceed to
designated safety zones.</i>

1338
01:48:53,173 --> 01:48:55,108
All S.H.I.E.L.D.
agents regroup at Rally Point Delta.

1339
01:49:00,773 --> 01:49:02,901
<i>Sir, the Council's been breached.</i>

1340
01:49:03,213 --> 01:49:05,614
<i>- Repeat, Dispatch.
- Black Widow's up there.</i>

1341
01:49:05,813 --> 01:49:07,144
Headed up.

1342
01:49:09,333 --> 01:49:10,619
<i>- Falcon?
- Yeah.</i>

1343
01:49:10,733 --> 01:49:11,748
Rumlow's headed for the Council.

1344
01:49:11,773 --> 01:49:12,774
I'm on it.

1345
01:49:24,373 --> 01:49:25,453
People are gonna die, Buck.

1346
01:49:27,533 --> 01:49:29,023
I can't let that happen.

1347
01:49:37,453 --> 01:49:38,818
Please don't make me do this.

1348
01:50:49,013 --> 01:50:50,060
Done.

1349
01:50:51,053 --> 01:50:52,054
And it's trending.

1350
01:50:59,693 --> 01:51:01,588
Unless you want a two-inch
hole in your sternum,

1351
01:51:01,613 --> 01:51:02,739
I'd put that gun down.

1352
01:51:05,413 --> 01:51:07,381
That was armed the moment
you pinned it on.

1353
01:51:26,253 --> 01:51:27,254
Ahhh!

1354
01:51:41,213 --> 01:51:42,294
Drop it!

1355
01:51:42,933 --> 01:51:43,934
Drop it!

1356
01:52:04,453 --> 01:52:07,696
I'm on 41, headed toward
the southwest stairwell.

1357
01:52:14,413 --> 01:52:16,017
This is gonna hurt.

1358
01:52:17,293 --> 01:52:20,376
There are no prisoners with HYDRA.
Just order.

1359
01:52:20,573 --> 01:52:22,814
And order only comes through pain.

1360
01:52:24,213 --> 01:52:26,580
- You ready for yours?
- Man, shut the hell up.

1361
01:52:28,373 --> 01:52:29,788
Lieutenant, how much longer?

1362
01:52:29,813 --> 01:52:31,948
<i>65 seconds to satellite link.</i>

1363
01:52:31,973 --> 01:52:34,977
Targeting grid engaged.
Lowering weapons array now.

1364
01:52:38,973 --> 01:52:40,054
One minute.

1365
01:52:59,973 --> 01:53:01,498
<i>30 seconds, Cap.</i>

1366
01:53:03,133 --> 01:53:04,658
Stand by.

1367
01:53:07,333 --> 01:53:08,983
Charlie...

1368
01:53:18,253 --> 01:53:20,548
<i>We've reached 3,000 feet.</i>

1369
01:53:20,573 --> 01:53:21,653
Sat link coming online now.

1370
01:53:24,093 --> 01:53:25,174
Deploy algorithm.

1371
01:53:26,853 --> 01:53:28,493
Algorithm deployed.

1372
01:53:29,253 --> 01:53:30,773
<i>We are go to target.</i>

1373
01:53:49,773 --> 01:53:51,138
<i>Target saturation reached.</i>

1374
01:53:51,533 --> 01:53:52,588
All targets assigned.

1375
01:53:52,613 --> 01:53:53,660
Fire when ready.

1376
01:53:56,133 --> 01:53:57,339
Firing in...

1377
01:53:57,493 --> 01:53:58,574
<i>3,</i>

1378
01:53:58,853 --> 01:53:59,908
2...

1379
01:54:01,053 --> 01:54:02,384
1.

1380
01:54:05,053 --> 01:54:06,100
Charlie lock.

1381
01:54:06,573 --> 01:54:07,574
Where are the targets?

1382
01:54:09,053 --> 01:54:10,054
Where are the targets?

1383
01:54:10,693 --> 01:54:11,899
Okay, Cap, get out of there.

1384
01:54:29,333 --> 01:54:30,334
Fire now.

1385
01:54:31,413 --> 01:54:32,653
- But, Steve...
- Do it!

1386
01:54:33,413 --> 01:54:34,574
<i>Do it now!</i>

1387
01:55:05,133 --> 01:55:06,134
What a waste.

1388
01:55:06,293 --> 01:55:09,502
So, you still on the fence
about Rogers' chances?

1389
01:55:09,693 --> 01:55:12,776
Time to go, Councilwoman. This way.
Come on.

1390
01:55:13,253 --> 01:55:14,778
You're going to fly me out of here.

1391
01:55:14,973 --> 01:55:18,136
You know, there was a time
I would've taken a bullet for you.

1392
01:55:18,333 --> 01:55:19,664
You already did.

1393
01:55:19,813 --> 01:55:21,781
You will again, when it's useful.

1394
01:55:35,093 --> 01:55:36,254
Romanoff.

1395
01:55:36,973 --> 01:55:38,054
Natasha.

1396
01:55:40,133 --> 01:55:41,897
Natasha! Come on!

1397
01:55:46,293 --> 01:55:47,533
Ow.

1398
01:55:48,973 --> 01:55:50,498
Those really do sting.

1399
01:56:23,533 --> 01:56:24,944
Hail HYDRA.

1400
01:57:20,413 --> 01:57:21,903
You're out of your depth, kid.

1401
01:57:25,613 --> 01:57:27,103
Son of a bitch!

1402
01:57:39,253 --> 01:57:41,093
Please tell me you got
that chopper in the air!

1403
01:57:41,613 --> 01:57:43,173
<i>Sam, where are you?</i>

1404
01:57:43,613 --> 01:57:45,456
41st floor! Northwest corner!

1405
01:57:45,653 --> 01:57:47,223
We're on it! Stay where you are!

1406
01:57:47,413 --> 01:57:48,494
Not an option!

1407
01:58:03,293 --> 01:58:05,455
41st floor! 41st!

1408
01:58:05,813 --> 01:58:09,135
It's not like they put the floor numbers
on the outside of the building.

1409
01:58:10,533 --> 01:58:13,013
Hill! Where's Steve?
You got a location on Rogers?

1410
01:58:29,493 --> 01:58:30,574
You know me.

1411
01:58:32,333 --> 01:58:33,664
No, I don't!

1412
01:58:43,173 --> 01:58:44,504
Bucky.

1413
01:58:46,013 --> 01:58:47,458
You've known me your whole life.

1414
01:58:55,013 --> 01:58:58,938
Your name is James Buchanan Barnes.

1415
01:58:59,133 --> 01:59:00,373
Shut up!

1416
01:59:09,093 --> 01:59:10,538
I'm not gonna fight you.

1417
01:59:14,533 --> 01:59:15,864
You're my friend.

1418
01:59:22,893 --> 01:59:24,258
You're my mission.

1419
01:59:26,533 --> 01:59:28,535
You're my mission!

1420
01:59:31,893 --> 01:59:32,894
Then finish it.

1421
01:59:36,373 --> 01:59:38,580
Because I'm with you
to the end of the line.

1422
02:01:50,253 --> 02:01:51,584
On your left.

1423
02:02:42,573 --> 02:02:44,974
<i>Do you solemnly
swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,</i>

1424
02:02:45,173 --> 02:02:46,254
<i>and nothing but the truth?</i>

1425
02:02:46,453 --> 02:02:47,898
<i>I do.</i>

1426
02:02:49,893 --> 02:02:51,577
<i>Why haven't
we yet heard from Captain Rogers?</i>

1427
02:02:54,293 --> 02:02:56,216
I don't know what there is
left for him to say.

1428
02:02:56,413 --> 02:02:58,256
I think the wreck in
the middle of the Potomac

1429
02:02:58,453 --> 02:02:59,828
made his point fairly eloquently.

1430
02:02:59,853 --> 02:03:00,820
Well, he could explain how

1431
02:03:01,013 --> 02:03:03,619
this country is expected to maintain
its national security

1432
02:03:03,773 --> 02:03:07,903
now that he and you have laid waste
to our intelligence apparatus.

1433
02:03:08,293 --> 02:03:10,295
HYDRA was selling you lies,
not intelligence.

1434
02:03:10,453 --> 02:03:13,343
Many of which you seemed to have had
a personal hand in telling.

1435
02:03:13,533 --> 02:03:14,773
Agent, you should know

1436
02:03:14,933 --> 02:03:16,617
that there are some on this committee

1437
02:03:16,813 --> 02:03:18,941
who feel, given your service record,

1438
02:03:19,133 --> 02:03:20,862
both for this country and against it,

1439
02:03:21,613 --> 02:03:23,377
that you belong in a penitentiary.

1440
02:03:23,573 --> 02:03:25,541
Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.

1441
02:03:27,453 --> 02:03:29,057
You're not going to put me in a prison.

1442
02:03:30,053 --> 02:03:33,978
You're not going to put any of us
in a prison. You know why?

1443
02:03:35,413 --> 02:03:36,824
Do enlighten us.

1444
02:03:37,093 --> 02:03:38,424
Because you need us.

1445
02:03:39,533 --> 02:03:41,820
<i>Yes, the world is a vulnerable place,</i>

1446
02:03:42,013 --> 02:03:44,175
<i>and yes, we help make it that way.</i>

1447
02:03:44,733 --> 02:03:47,498
<i>But we're also the ones
best qualified to defend it.</i>

1448
02:03:49,133 --> 02:03:51,101
So, if you want to arrest me, arrest me.

1449
02:03:52,133 --> 02:03:53,817
You'll know where to find me.

1450
02:04:29,293 --> 02:04:32,137
So, you've experienced
this sort of thing before.

1451
02:04:32,653 --> 02:04:34,178
You get used to it.

1452
02:04:36,893 --> 02:04:39,055
We've been data mining HYDRA'S files.

1453
02:04:39,293 --> 02:04:41,421
Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.

1454
02:04:42,973 --> 02:04:44,338
I'm headed to Europe tonight.

1455
02:04:45,293 --> 02:04:46,533
Wanted to ask if you'd come.

1456
02:04:47,693 --> 02:04:49,343
There's something I got to do first.

1457
02:04:50,253 --> 02:04:52,779
How about you, Wilson?
Could use a man with your abilities.

1458
02:04:53,853 --> 02:04:55,537
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

1459
02:04:56,653 --> 02:04:58,417
All right, then.

1460
02:05:03,053 --> 02:05:07,263
Anybody asks for me,
tell them they can find me, right here.

1461
02:05:09,053 --> 02:05:10,657
You should be honoured.
That's about as close as he gets

1462
02:05:10,853 --> 02:05:12,503
to saying thank you.

1463
02:05:13,653 --> 02:05:14,734
Not going with him?

1464
02:05:15,213 --> 02:05:16,499
No.

1465
02:05:16,693 --> 02:05:18,695
- Not staying here.
- Nah.

1466
02:05:19,533 --> 02:05:21,693
I blew all my covers.
I got to go figure out a new one.

1467
02:05:21,893 --> 02:05:22,894
That might take a while.

1468
02:05:23,413 --> 02:05:25,017
I'm counting on it.

1469
02:05:27,253 --> 02:05:28,379
That thing you asked for,

1470
02:05:28,733 --> 02:05:31,054
I called in a few favours from Kiev.

1471
02:05:34,013 --> 02:05:36,744
Will you do me a favour? Call that nurse.

1472
02:05:37,173 --> 02:05:38,379
She's not a nurse.

1473
02:05:38,573 --> 02:05:40,416
And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

1474
02:05:41,333 --> 02:05:43,415
- What was her name again?
- Sharon.

1475
02:05:44,173 --> 02:05:45,174
She's nice.

1476
02:05:57,653 --> 02:05:59,417
Be careful, Steve.

1477
02:06:00,253 --> 02:06:01,982
You might not want to
pull on that thread.

1478
02:06:13,533 --> 02:06:15,297
You're going after him.

1479
02:06:15,693 --> 02:06:16,979
You don't have to come with me.

1480
02:06:17,133 --> 02:06:18,214
I know.

1481
02:06:20,173 --> 02:06:21,334
When do we start?

1482
02:08:20,733 --> 02:08:24,374
It's over. Fury has released
everything to the public.

1483
02:08:25,093 --> 02:08:26,424
Everything he knows about.

1484
02:08:27,013 --> 02:08:28,933
<i>Herr Strucker, if they get
word of our work here,</i>

1485
02:08:29,053 --> 02:08:30,862
if they find out we serve HYDRA...

1486
02:08:31,053 --> 02:08:32,782
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.

1487
02:08:33,773 --> 02:08:36,617
Two sides of a coin
that's no longer currency.

1488
02:08:40,453 --> 02:08:41,943
What we have

1489
02:08:43,973 --> 02:08:46,624
is worth more than
any of them ever knew.

1490
02:08:49,253 --> 02:08:52,939
We've only scratched
the surface and already,

1491
02:08:55,733 --> 02:08:59,579
there are other facilities doing
HYDRA'S good work around the world.

1492
02:09:00,733 --> 02:09:04,180
We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colourful friends,

1493
02:09:04,373 --> 02:09:06,216
and keep them off our scent.

1494
02:09:06,413 --> 02:09:08,654
What about the volunteers?

1495
02:09:08,893 --> 02:09:10,418
The dead will be buried so deep

1496
02:09:10,653 --> 02:09:12,781
their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.

1497
02:09:14,853 --> 02:09:16,093
And the survivors?

1498
02:09:18,213 --> 02:09:19,738
The twins.

1499
02:09:23,293 --> 02:09:26,422
Sooner or later, they will meet the twins.

1500
02:09:28,613 --> 02:09:30,536
It's not a world of spies any more.

1501
02:09:30,733 --> 02:09:32,701
Not even a world of heroes.

1502
02:09:33,693 --> 02:09:36,424
This is the age of miracles, Doctor.

1503
02:09:38,293 --> 02:09:40,580
There's nothing more horrifying

1504
02:09:41,413 --> 02:09:42,539
than a miracle.
