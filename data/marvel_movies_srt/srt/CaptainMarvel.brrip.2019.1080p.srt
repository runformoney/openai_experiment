00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what time it is?</font>

2
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't sleep.</font>

3
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are tabs for that.</font>

4
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but then
I'd be sleeping.</font>

5
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dreams again?</font>

6
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanna fight?</font>

7
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I slipped.</font>

8
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, you slipped</font>

9
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a result of me
punching you in the face.</font>

10
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was already slipping</font>

11
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you happened
to punch me in the face.</font>

12
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The two events
were not related.</font>

13
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me about this dream.</font>

14
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Anything new?
- No.</font>

15
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to let go
of the past.</font>

16
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't remember my past.</font>

17
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's causing you doubt,</font>

18
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and doubt
makes you vulnerable.</font>

19
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Control it.</font>

20
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lose control again,
and you'll have to commune</font>

21
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the Supreme Intelligence.</font>

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing more dangerous
to a warrior than emotion.</font>

23
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Humor is a distraction.</font>

24
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And anger?</font>

25
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anger only serves the enemy.</font>

26
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>120 days</i></font>

27
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>since the last Skrull attack.</i></font>

28
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Has anyone ever seen</i></font>

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what the Supreme Intelligence
really looks like?</font>

30
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one can look upon
the Supreme Intelligence</font>

31
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in its true form.</font>

32
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know that.</font>

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our subconscious chooses
the way they appear to us.</font>

34
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it's sacred. It's personal.</font>

35
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No Kree divulges it, ever.</font>

36
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who do you see?</font>

37
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Your brother?
- No.</font>

38
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Father?
- No.</font>

39
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Your old commander?
- Vers.</font>

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's me you see, isn't it?</font>

41
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see
what you're trying to do.</font>

42
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is it working?
- Yes.</font>

43
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you won't succeed
in changing the subject.</font>

44
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is the point of
giving me these...</font>

45
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you don't want me
to use them?</font>

46
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to use them.</font>

47
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Supreme Intelligence
gave me a responsibility...</font>

48
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of showing you
how to use them.</font>

49
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know how.</font>

50
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, if that were true,
you'd be able to</font>

51
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">knock me down without them.</font>

52
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Control your impulses.</font>

53
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop using this,
start using this.</font>

54
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to be
the best version of yourself.</font>

55
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vers.</font>

56
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Intelligence.</font>

57
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your commander insists
that you're fit to serve.</font>

58
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am.</font>

59
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You struggle
with your emotions...</font>

60
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with your past,
which fuels them.</font>

61
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are just one victim
of the Skrull expansion...</font>

62
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that has threatened our
civilization for centuries.</font>

63
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imposters
who silently infiltrate...</font>

64
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then take over our planets.</font>

65
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Horrors that you remember...</font>

66
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and so much that you do not.</font>

67
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all blank.
My life.</font>

68
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're supposed
to take the form</font>

69
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of who I most admire...</font>

70
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I don't even remember
who this person was to me.</font>

71
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps this is a mercy</font>

72
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sparing you
from a deeper pain.</font>

73
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freeing you
to do what all Kree must...</font>

74
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">put your people's needs
before your own.</font>

75
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've given you a great gift.</font>

76
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The chance to fight
for the good of all Kree.</font>

77
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to serve.</font>

78
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then master yourself.</font>

79
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was given
can be taken away.</font>

80
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't let you down.</font>

81
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll know soon enough.</font>

82
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a mission.</font>

83
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Serve well, and with honor.</font>

84
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This can't be good.</font>

85
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must be another Skrull attack.</font>

86
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever it is, it's big.</font>

87
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Has a Skrull ever simmed you?</font>

88
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once.</font>

89
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It was deeply disturbing.
- Why?</font>

90
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I stared into
the face of my mortal enemy...</font>

91
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the face staring back
was my own.</font>

92
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe if you were
more attractive,</font>

93
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then it would be
less disturbing.</font>

94
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you're funny,
but I'm not laughing.</font>

95
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never laugh.</font>

96
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I laugh on the inside.</font>

97
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not doing that now.</font>

98
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's funny 'cause,
objectively speaking,</font>

99
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're quite handsome.</font>

100
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, thank you.</font>

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen up, team.
Knock it off.</font>

102
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

103
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prepare for...</font>

104
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a search and rescue
of our spy, Soh-Larr.</font>

yet another border planet.</font>

107
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soh-Larr sent us a warning.</font>

108
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The signal was intercepted,
and his cover's blown.</font>

109
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Skrull general, Talos,</font>

110
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has sent kill units
to find him.</font>

111
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should they reach him
before we do...</font>

112
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the intelligence he's acquired</font>

113
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over 3 years
is as good as theirs.</font>

114
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Accusers will bomb</font>

115
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a Skrull stronghold
here in the south.</font>

116
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We slip in,
we locate Soh-Larr...</font>

117
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we get out,
leaving them none the wiser.</font>

118
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Torfan populace.</font>

119
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are not to interfere
with them,</font>

120
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">nor them with us.</font>

121
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing compromises
the security of our mission.</font>

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Proceed with caution.</font>

123
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow protocol
before extracting him.</font>

124
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a dangerous mission.</font>

125
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must all be ready
to join the Collective</font>

126
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if that is our fate today.</font>

127
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080

129
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon.</font>

130
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Att-Lass, Minn-Erva,
find elevation.</font>

131
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Locals on the periphery.</font>

132
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe a dozen.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you read me?
Does anybody copy?</font>

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Repeat.</font>

that temple. Let's move.</font>

137
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. This is a perfect spot
for an ambush.</font>

138

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only one way in,
only one way out.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to go with me.
I'll go alone.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're too emotional.</font>

201
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,594

a cockpit, don't you?</font>

202
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A huge rumble throughout

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sound familiar?</font>

218
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flying your planes
never feels like work.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'd say fine...</font>

411
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it can't believe
what it's seeing.</font>

412
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:35,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You say this thing
looked like Coulson?</font>

413
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm. Talked like him, too.</font>

414
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the woman said
that there were more?</font>

415
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The word she used
was "infiltration."</font>

416
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You believe her?</font>

417
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not till I saw this.</font>

418
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your plan?</font>

419
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll find Blockbuster girl.</font>

420
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got word
on a motorcycle thief</font>

421
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that fits her description.</font>

422
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If she can tell us
why these lizards are here...</font>

423
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">maybe she can tell us
how to kick 'em to the curb.</font>

424
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

425
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it alone, though.
We can't trust anyone.</font>

426
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not even our own men.</font>

427
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

428
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. They're ugly bastards,
aren't they?</font>

429
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah,
well, he's no Brad Pitt, sir.</font>

430
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Safe journey to the beyond,
my friend.</font>

431
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will finish what we started.</font>

432
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't get
too close there, boss.</font>

433
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one in or out.</font>

434
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boom!</font>

435
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What can I get ya?</font>

436
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where was
this photograph taken?</font>

437
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An airport.</font>

438
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Pegasus?</font>

439
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's classified.</font>

440
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not unlike the file
I started on you.</font>

441
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I see you've changed it up
a bit since then.</font>

442
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grunge is a good look for you.</font>

443
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you have a rough day,
Agent Fury?</font>

444
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was cool, you know?</font>

445
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Had a space invasion,
big car chase.</font>

446
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got to watch an alien autopsy.</font>

447
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Typical 9-to-5.</font>

448
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you saw one?</font>

449
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was never one
to believe in aliens...</font>

450
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I can't unsee that.</font>

451
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is gonna get a little
awkward, but I gotta ask.</font>

452
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think I'm one of those
green things.</font>

453
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't be too careful.</font>

454
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are looking at
100% red-blooded Earth man.</font>

455
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm afraid
I'm gonna need proof.</font>

456
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We talking cheek swab
or urine sample?</font>

457
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. The DNA would match.</font>

458
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Want my AOL password?</font>

459
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Skrulls can only sim
recent memories</font>

460
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- of their host bodies.
- Oh, oh.</font>

461
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna get personal.</font>

462
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where were you born?
- Huntsville, Alabama.</font>

463
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But technically,
I don't remember that part.</font>

464
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Name of your first pet?
- Mr. Snoofers.</font>

465
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mr. Snoofers?
- That's what I said.</font>

466
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I pass?</font>

467
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not yet. First job?</font>

468
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soldier.
Straight out of high school.</font>

469
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Left the ranks
a full bird colonel.</font>

470
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Then?
- Spy.</font>

471
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where?
- It was the Cold War.</font>

472
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were everywhere.</font>

473
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, Belfast. Bucharest.
Belgrade. Budapest.</font>

474
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like the B's.
I can make them rhyme.</font>

475
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now?
- Been riding a desk</font>

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the past 6 years...</font>

477
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">trying to figure out
where our</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">future enemies
are coming from.</font>

479
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never occurred to me</font>

480
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they would be coming
from above.</font>

481
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Name a detail so bizarre</font>

482
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a Skrull could never
fabricate it.</font>

483
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If toast is cut diagonally,
I can't eat it.</font>

484
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't need that, did you?</font>

485
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, I didn't.
But I enjoyed it.</font>

486
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Your turn.</font>

487
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prove you're not a Skrull.</font>

488
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how is that
supposed to prove to me</font>

489
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're not a Skrull?</font>

490
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a photon blast.</font>

491
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And?</font>

492
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A Skrull can't do that.</font>

493
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, a full bird colonel</font>

494
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">turned spy
turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent...</font>

495
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">must have pretty high
security clearance.</font>

496
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Pegasus?</font>

497
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.
The Skrulls sim alien races</font>

498
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to infiltrate
and take over planets.</font>

499
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're a Kree?
A race of noble warriors?</font>

500
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heroes. Noble warrior heroes.</font>

501
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, um, what do Skrulls
want with Dr. Lawson?</font>

502
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They believe
that she developed</font>

503
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a light-speed engine
at Pegasus.</font>

504
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Light-speed engine?</font>

505
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotta admit, that's not</font>

506
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the craziest thing
I've heard today.</font>

507
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's still early.</font>

508
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you, what do you want?</font>

509
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To stop the Skrulls before
they become unstoppable.</font>

510
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And?</font>

511
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, war is
a universal language.</font>

512
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know a rogue soldier

545
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, this ain't it.</font>

546
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that a communicator?</font>

547
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. State-of-the-art
two-way pager.</font>

548
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you paging?</font>

549
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mom. Don't worry.
I didn't mention you.</font>

550
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After you.</font>

551
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Impressive.</font>

552
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you should see what I can
do with a paperclip.</font>

553
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, there. How are you?</font>

554
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my goodness. Look at you.
Just look at you.</font>

555
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't you
the cutest little thing?</font>

556
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't you cute?
And what's your name, huh?</font>

557
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your name?</font>

558
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Goose."
Cool name for a cool cat.</font>

559
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fury?</font>

560
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm?</font>

561
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be back.</font>

562
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Let me get
my fingerprint out.</font>

563
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just let me unravel
this puppy.</font>

564
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sat there and watched me
play with tape?</font>

565
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When all you had to do was...</font>

566
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't wanna steal
your thunder.</font>

567
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh. Lawson.</font>

568
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lawson's plan
for the light-speed engine.</font>

569
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wonder why
they terminated the project.</font>

570
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, maybe because
she's cuckoo.</font>

571
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kree glyphs?</font>

572
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm?</font>

573
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lawson is not cuckoo.</font>

574
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's Kree.</font>

575
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, she's dead.</font>

576
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

577
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She crashed the Asis aircraft</font>

578
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">doing an unauthorized
test flight.</font>

579
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Took a pilot down with her.</font>

580
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why security here
is so unfriendly.</font>

581
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're covering up
a billion-dollar mistake.</font>

582
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and your light-speed
engine is toast.</font>

583
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When did this crash happen?</font>

584
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6 years ago. 1989.</font>

585
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who was the pilot?</font>

586
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, most of
this thing's redacted...</font>

587
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but there is a testimonial
here from a Maria Rambeau.</font>

588
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last person to see them alive.</font>

589
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

590
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm-hmm.</font>

591
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back in a minute.</font>

592
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't about
fighting wars.</font>

593
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's about ending them.</font>

594
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I know Lawson was Kree.</i></font>

595
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was here on C-53
and died in a plane crash.</font>

596
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Do you know anything
about this?</i></font>

597
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just discovered
a mission report</font>

598
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sent from C-53.</font>

599
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only so much</font>

600
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm cleared to tell you,
Vers, but...</font>

601
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Lawson was an undercover
Kree operative named Mar-Vell.</i></font>

602
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was working
on a unique energy core.</font>

603
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Experimenting with tech</font>

604
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that apparently could help us
win the war.</font>

605
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She still here?</font>

606
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's cooperating
with the investigation, sir.</font>

607
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You men stay here.
- Yes, sir.</font>

608
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to question her alone.</font>

609
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excellent work, Nicholas.</font>

610
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does it say anything about me?</font>

611
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything about you?
No, of course not.</font>

612
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Why would it?</i></font>

613
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:37,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found evidence
that I had a life here.</font>

614
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>On C-53?</i></font>

615
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mar-Vell is who I see</font>

616
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I visit
the Supreme Intelligence.</font>

617
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew her.
And I knew her as Lawson.</font>

618
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This sounds like
Skrull simulation, Vers.</font>

619
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's not. Because I
remember. I was here.</font>

620
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Stop. Remember your training.</i></font>

621
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Know your enemy.
It could be you.</font>

622
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Do not let your emotions
override your judgment.</i></font>

623
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's on sublevel 6.</font>

624
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get off on 5...</font>

625
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and take the stairs in case
she makes a run for it.</font>

626
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do a pincer move
like we did in Havana.</font>

627
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Like we did in Havana.</font>

628
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We're nearing
the jump point.</i></font>

629
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Leave your beacon on
so I can find you.</i></font>

630
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll get to
the bottom of this, Vers.</font>

631
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Together.</font>

632
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

633
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vers!</font>

634
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vers!</font>

635
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fury's colluding
with the target.</font>

636
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then why would he call us in?</font>

637
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I know is we take
him in, too. Dead or alive.</font>

638
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dead or alive?</font>

639
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. Go, go!</font>

640
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was it something I said?</font>

641
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm-mmm.</font>

642
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:36,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you know, I don't really
need these to see...</font>

643
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but they do
kinda complete the look.</font>

644
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you think?</font>

645
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You called them in?</font>

646
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My bad.</font>

647
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coulson,
do you have eyes on them?</font>

648
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not down here.</font>

649
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's try up there.</font>

650
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Your communicator.</font>

651
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You obviously
can't be trusted with it.</font>

652
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know
how to fly this thing?</font>

653
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, we'll see.</font>

654
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a yes or no question.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

657
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got a stowaway.</font>

658
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on, Goose.</font>

659
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goose.</font>

660

Huh, Goose?</font>

662
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,879

that's right.</font>

00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See anyone you know?</font>

666
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Funny story.</font>

667
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I arrived on Hala near dead.
No memory.</font>

672
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">could probably tell us.</font>

to Louisiana?</font>

Hang a right at Memphis.</font>

676
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That agent...</font>

677

00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, give him time.</font>

681
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess he had a feeling,
you know?</font>

682
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Went with his gut
against orders.</font>

683
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a really
hard thing to do.</font>

684
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's what keeps us human.</font>

685
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get in trouble for that.
A lot.</font>

686
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I can see that about you.</font>

687
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rescuing the guy who sold
you out to the Skrulls?</font>

688
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm guessing that's not</font>

689
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">standard
Kree operating procedure.</font>

690
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I won't tell your boss
if you don't tell mine.</font>

691
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ronan.</font>

692
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The Accusers completed
their operation...</i></font>

693
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>but the greater mission
was a failure,</i></font>

694
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>thanks to your team.</i></font>

695
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a trap</font>

696
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to lure our operative Vers
to Torfa and kidnap her.</font>

697
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Give us their location.</i></font>

698
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We'll take care
of the terrorist threat.</i></font>

699
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By bombing them
out of the galaxy?</font>

700
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we'll handle this.</font>

701
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A cell of Skrulls anywhere</i></font>

702
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>is a threat
to Kree everywhere.</i></font>

703
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Where are they?</i></font>

704
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They are...
- Lost.</font>

705
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are lost for now.</font>

706
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we will find them.</font>

707
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Do so, or we will.</i></font>

708
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maintain the course for C-53.</font>

709
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me,
I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.</font>

710
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Auntie Carol?</font>

711
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, it's Auntie Carol!</font>

712
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it!
Everyone said you were dead!</font>

713
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we knew they were lying.</font>

714
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not really
who you think I am.</font>

715
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is the craziest shit
I ever heard.</font>

716
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Green transforming aliens?
There's no such thing.</font>

717
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are
absolutely right, young lady.</font>

718
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no such thing.</font>

719
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause if there were,</font>

720
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we would want to keep that
to ourselves.</font>

721
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't believe me?</font>

722
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way!</font>

723
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's so cool!</font>

724
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, she can do
a lot more than make tea</font>

725
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with those hands.</font>

726
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like what? Show us.</font>

727
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe later.</font>

728
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I kept all your stuff.</font>

729
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll go get it.</font>

730
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to give her
a hand with that?</font>

731
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm?</font>

732
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't remember anything?</font>

733
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see flashes.</font>

734
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little moments.</font>

735
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I can't tell what's real.</font>

736
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...</font>

737
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">maybe it'll all make sense.</font>

738
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You woke me up
banging on my door at dawn.</font>

739
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your usual move.</font>

740
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back then,
we had to get up so early.</font>

741
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat...</font>

742
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so testing Lawson's planes
was our only shot</font>

743
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at doing something
that mattered.</font>

744
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanted to race to base
in your old Mustang...</font>

745
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I wasn't about to argue,</font>

746
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause I knew
my Camaro would dominate.</font>

747
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you cheated,
took a shortcut.</font>

748
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since when is
a shortcut cheating?</font>

749
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since it violates
the predetermined</font>

750
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">rules of engagement.</font>

751
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I definitely
don't remember those.</font>

752
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm. Of course you don't.</font>

753
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:48,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was agitated.</font>

754
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said
she had lives to save.</font>

755
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was trying
to take the Asis up herself,</font>

756
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you said that...</font>

757
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If there were lives at stake,
I would fly the plane.</font>

758
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:03,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yep. Big hero moment.</font>

759
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The kind of moment
we'd both been waiting for.</font>

760
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The doc was always unique.
That's why we liked her.</font>

761
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:16,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now you're saying
she's from another planet.</font>

762
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know
this must be hard for you.</font>

763
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, what?
This part right here?</font>

764
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No. Mmm-mmm.</font>

765
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:31,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, what's hard
is losing my best friend...</font>

766
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a mission so secret</font>

767
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they act
like it never even happened.</font>

768
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hard is knowing
you were out there somewhere</font>

769
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">too damn stubborn to die.</font>

770
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now you come up in here
after 6 years...</font>

771
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with your supercharged
fire hands...</font>

772
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you expect me
to call you...</font>

773
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't even know what. Vers?</font>

774
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that really
who you are now?</font>

775
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

776
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come look!</font>

777
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is me
and you on Halloween.</font>

778
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Amelia Earhart
and you're Janis Joplin.</font>

779
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, this is you
when you were little.</font>

780
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't get along
with your parents...</font>

781
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so Mom said
we became your real family.</font>

782
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is us on Christmas.</font>

783
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got my favorite
bunny slippers.</font>

784
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is another picture of you
when you were little.</font>

785
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've always wanted
to be a pilot.</font>

786
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this is right after
you graduated.</font>

787
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was your dog
that you got for Christmas...</font>

788
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a picture of everybody
from your Air Force team.</font>

789
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this is you with Mom</font>

790
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">right after a good day
of training.</font>

791
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These were
your three favorite guys.</font>

792
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wait. I forgot.</font>

793
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your jacket.</font>

794
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom doesn't
let me wear it anymore</font>

795
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after I spilled ketchup on it.</font>

796
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was all
that survived the crash.</font>

797
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or so we thought.</font>

798
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't answer that.</font>

799
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just my neighbor.</font>

800
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They can change into anyone.</font>

801
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi there.</font>

802
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want?</font>

803
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh...
- Hey, Tom.</font>

804
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my friend, Carol.</font>

805
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Pleased to meet you.</font>

806
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yowzers.</font>

807
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Static electricity
out here's no joke.</font>

808
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...</font>

809
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I was just wondering...</font>

810
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you mind
if I bring the boys over</font>

811
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to get a closer look-see?</font>

812
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A closer look-see?
- Yeah.</font>

813
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To see the "bird"
parked out by the road?</font>

814
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

815
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're really working overtime</font>

816
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to sell this one,
aren't you, Talos?</font>

817
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Tom.
This really isn't a good time.</font>

818
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll come by tomorrow, okay?</font>

819
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh...
- Okay.</font>

820
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, you really should be
kinder to your neighbors.</font>

821
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never know
when you're gonna need</font>

822
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to borrow some sugar.</font>

823
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, hang on a second.</font>

824
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:19,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before you go swinging
those jazz hands around...</font>

825
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">making a mess
of your friend's house...</font>

826
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a lovely home, miss.</font>

827
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

828
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

829
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one's gonna hurt the girl.</font>

830
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just don't kill me.</font>

831
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would really complicate
the situation.</font>

832
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm about 5 seconds
from complicating that wall</font>

833
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with some ugly-ass
Skrull brains.</font>

834
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry
I simmed your boss.</font>

835
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now I stand before you
as my true self.</font>

836
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without deception.</font>

837
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who is that out there?</font>

838
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, that's a fair point...</font>

839
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'm sure
that you understand</font>

840
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to take
some precautions.</font>

841
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw you crush
20 of my best men</font>

842
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with your hands bound.</font>

843
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wanna talk.</font>

844
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last time we talked,</font>

845
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ended up
hanging from my ankles.</font>

846
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was before I knew
who you were.</font>

847
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before I knew what made you
different from the others.</font>

848
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:14,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have an audio recording
from Pegasus...</font>

849
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of your voice
from a plane crash</font>

850

<font face="Comic Sans MS">6 years ago...</font>

851
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on a device I believe you call
a "black box."</font>

852
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They told me it was destroyed
in the crash.</font>

853
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you get it?</font>

854
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She don't understand.</font>

855
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Young lady,
I have a special skill...</font>

856
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that kind of allows me</font>

857
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to get into places
I'm not supposed to be.</font>

858
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call me "young lady" again...</font>

859
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna put my foot
in a place</font>

860
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's not supposed to be.</font>

861
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I supposed to guess
where that is?</font>

862
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your ass.</font>

863
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I get it. We're all
a little on edge here.</font>

864
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, look,
I just need your help</font>

865
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">decoding some coordinates.</font>

866
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you'll sit down
and you'll listen to this...</font>

867
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:56,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I assure you,
it'll be worth your while.</font>

868
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:01,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.</font>

869
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deal.</font>

870
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!
Get that thing away.</font>

871
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd that get in here?</font>

872
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm?</font>

873
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The cat?</font>

874
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?</font>

875
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not a cat.</font>

876
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's a Flerken.
- A Flerken?</font>

877
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom?</font>

878
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Monica.</font>

879
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why can't I listen, too?
- Shh!</font>

880
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's happening?</font>

881
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's loading.</font>

Who the hell are they?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those are the bad guys.
Fly faster now!</font>

our work here? What it's for?</font>

912
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,955

that you're delusional...</font>

fighting a shameful war.</font>

922
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, skedaddle
before you give me</font>

925
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta save 'em without me.</font>

926
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Save who? How?</font>

927
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I gotta blow this engine
before they find it.</font>

928
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

929
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have no interest
in hurting you.</font>

930
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pararescue's on the way.</font>

935
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have 2 minutes
until you're surrounded.</font>

936
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I see no reason
to prolong this conversation.</font>

937

<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, wait!</font>

938
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,514

<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

940

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you understand.</font>

01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?
What do I understand now?</font>

950
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.</font>

951
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He killed her...</font>

952
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause she found out
that she was</font>

953
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the wrong side
of an unjust war.</font>

954
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

955
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your people are terrorists.</font>

956
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They kill innocents.</font>

957
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw the ruins on Torfa.</font>

958
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.</font>

959
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.</font>

960
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...</font>

961
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they destroyed our planet.</font>

962
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the handful of us
that are left</font>

963
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will be slaughtered next...</font>

964
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:22,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.</font>

965
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The core that she found</font>

966
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would have powered
a light-speed ship...</font>

967
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">capable of carrying us
to safety.</font>

968
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:33,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.</font>

969
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus</font>

970
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wasn't to fight wars...</font>

971
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but to end them.</font>

972
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:45,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She wanted you to help us
find the core.</font>

973
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I already destroyed it.</font>

974
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you destroyed the engine.</font>

975
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The core that powered it
is in a remote location.</font>

976
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:56,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you help us
decode those coordinates...</font>

977
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:58,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we can find it.</font>

978
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll use it to destroy us.</font>

979
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just want a home.</font>

980
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:16,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.</font>

981
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't you see it now?</font>

982
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not one of them.</font>

983
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know me.</font>

984
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have no idea who I am.</font>

985
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:33,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't even know who I am!</font>

986
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are Carol Danvers.</font>

987
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are the woman
on that black box</font>

988
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">risking her life
to do the right thing.</font>

989
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My best friend...</font>

990
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who supported me
as a mother and a pilot</font>

991
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when no one else did.</font>

992
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:56,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...</font>

993
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you were the most
powerful person I knew...</font>

994
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:03,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.</font>

995
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hear me?</font>

996
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you hear me?</font>

997
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here. Come here, girl.</font>

998
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you.</font>

999
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:27,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I know
I don't deserve your trust...</i></font>

1000
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you were our only lead.</font>

1001
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We discovered
that your energy signature</font>

1002
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:34,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">matched Mar-Vell's core.</font>

1003
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we know why.</font>

1004
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:43,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If only you knew
the importance of it to me.</font>

1005
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just need your help</font>

1006
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.</font>

1007
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.</font>

1008
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For orbital position
and velocity.</font>

1009
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't find her lab
on Earth,</font>

1010
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:58,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause it's not on Earth.</font>

1011
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was the location</font>

1012
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:01,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the date
of the crash 6 years ago.</font>

1013
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we track its course,</font>

1014
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we'll find it in orbit
right now.</font>

1015
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just basic physics.</font>

1016
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In orbit?</font>

1017
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was that so difficult
to figure out?</font>

1018
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean,
you're my science guy, right?</font>

1019
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yon-Rogg will catch up
to me soon.</font>

1020
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got to get to the core
before he does.</font>

1021
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm. We're going to space?</font>

1022
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In what?</font>

1023
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A few tweaks
to your vessel should do it.</font>

1024
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can handle
the modifications.</font>

1025
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm. Your science guy.</font>

1026
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I could use a copilot.</font>

1027
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, I can't.</font>

1028
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't leave Monica.</font>

1029
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, it's okay. I can stay
with Gramma and Paw-paw.</font>

1030
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no way I'm going,
baby. It's too dangerous.</font>

1031
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Testing brand-new aerospace
tech is dangerous...</font>

1032
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you used to do that.</font>

1033
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your plan
is to leave the atmosphere</font>

1034
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a craft not designed
for the journey...</font>

1035
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you anticipate
hostile encounters...</font>

1036
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:02,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with
a technologically-superior</font>

1037
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">foreign enemy.</font>

1038
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Correct?</font>

1039
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I'm saying.</font>

1040
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You have to go!
- Monica!</font>

1041
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:09,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a chance
to fly the coolest mission</font>

1042
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the history of missions...</font>

1043
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're gonna give it up
to sit on the couch</font>

1044
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and watch Fresh Prince
with me?</font>

1045
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:15,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1046
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:16,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just think
you should consider...</font>

1047
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what kind of example you're
setting for your daughter.</font>

1048
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on around here?</font>

1049
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, I know.</font>

1050
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll explain inside.
Thank you.</font>

1051
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mom's lucky.</font>

1052
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When they were
handing out kids,</font>

1053
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they gave her
the toughest one.</font>

1054
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant Trouble.</font>

1055
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You remembered.</font>

1056
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that mine?</font>

1057
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:51,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.</font>

1058
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hang on to it
until I come back.</font>

1059
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But there is something
that I need your help with.</font>

1060
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't wear
these Kree colors anymore.</font>

1061
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And since you are obviously
the only person around here</font>

1062
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with any sense of style...</font>

1063
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:07,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm?</font>

1064
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

1065
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:14,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1066
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-uh.</font>

1067
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Definitely not.</font>

1068
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:26,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, since we're
on the same team...</font>

1069
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:38,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

1070
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do I look?</font>

1071
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fresh.</font>

1072
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What took you so long?</font>

1073
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine. Thanks for asking.</font>

1074
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- PRY46-B...
- No, no codes.</font>

1075
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That system is fallible,
as we've learned.</font>

1076
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, then let's do this.</font>

1077
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:22,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who do I see when I commune
with the Supreme Intelligence?</font>

1078
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The person you most admire
and respect, I'd guess.</font>

1079
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:26,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you would never
tell me who.</font>

1080
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:31,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what is your
earliest memory of Hala?</font>

1081
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The transfusion.</font>

1082
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blue blood

01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:36,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They need their own home.</font>

1353
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be back
before you know it.</font>

1354
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:42,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or maybe I could fly up
and meet you halfway?</font>

1355
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:45,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.</font>

1356
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:47,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or maybe I'll build
a spaceship.</font>

1357
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You don't know.
- He doesn't.</font>

1358
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:01,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep the Tesseract on Earth.</font>

1359
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:03,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hidden.</font>

1360
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure that's what
Marvel would want?</font>

1361
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:07,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mar-Vell.</font>

1362
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:08,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I said.</font>

1363
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:11,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's two words. Mar. Vell.</font>

1364
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:12,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mar-Vell.</font>

1365
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:13,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Marvel" sounds a lot better.</font>

1366
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
like the Marvelettes.</font>

1367
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:30,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not ringing any bells?</font>

1368
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:32,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep singing.
Maybe it'll come back to me.</font>

1369
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:49,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I upgraded it.</font>

1370
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:52,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Range should be
a couple galaxies, at least.</font>

1371
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:56,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? You think
I'm gonna crank call you?</font>

1372
01:48:57,160 --> 01:49:00,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For emergencies only, okay?</font>

1373
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:07,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

1374
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:10,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you're ever passing
back through this galaxy...</font>

1375
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:12,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">be sure to give
a brother a shout.</font>

1376
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:16,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

1377
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got
the ketchup stain off.</font>

1378
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks,
Lieutenant Trouble.</font>

1379
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:41,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

1380
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:50,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's hard for me
to say goodbye, too.</font>

1381
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:05,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on.</font>

1382
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:15,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Glad to have you back, sir.
This came for you.</font>

1383
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:21,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, is it true?</font>

1384
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:23,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That the Kree
burned your eye out...</font>

1385
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:26,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because you refused
to give them the Tesseract?</font>

1386
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:30,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.</font>

1387
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:32,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Understood.</font>

1388
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:34,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry to report</font>

1389
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:35,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that we still haven't
found the Tesseract.</font>

1390
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure it'll turn up
somewhere.</font>

1391
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:41,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll let you know
when it does.</font>

1392
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:43,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then what?</font>

1393
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:44,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir?</font>

1394
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have no idea</font>

1395
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:49,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what other intergalactic
threats are out there.</font>

1396
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:51,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And our one-woman
security force</font>

1397
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:52,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">had a prior commitment...</font>

1398
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:54,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the other side
of the universe.</font>

1399
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:59,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.H.I.E.L.D. alone
can't protect us.</font>

1400
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to find more.</font>

1401
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:04,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More weapons?</font>

1402
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:05,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More heroes.</font>

1403
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:07,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you can find
others like her?</font>

1404
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:10,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm, we found her,
and we weren't even looking.</font>

1405
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:13,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get some rest, sir.</font>

1406
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:16,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got
a big decision to make.</font>

1407
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:16,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a nightmare.</font>

1408
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:20,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've had better nightmares.</font>

1409
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1410
01:55:25,120 --> 01:55:27,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, that thing just stopped</font>

1411
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:28,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">doing whatever the hell
it was doing.</font>

1412
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:32,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do we got?</font>

1413
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:35,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever signal it was sending
finally crapped out.</font>

1414
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:37,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought
we bypassed the battery.</font>

1415
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:38,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We did.</font>

1416
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:41,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's still plugged in.
It just stopped.</font>

1417
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:43,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reboot it.
Send the signal again.</font>

1418
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:45,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't even know
what this is.</font>

1419
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:48,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fury did. Just do it, please.</font>

1420
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:50,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tell me
the second you get a signal.</font>

1421
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna know who's on
the other end of that thing.</font>

1422
01:55:56,440 --> 01:55:57,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Fury?</font>
