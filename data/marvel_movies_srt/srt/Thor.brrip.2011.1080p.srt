00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait for it.</font>

2
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can I turn on the radio?
- No.</font>

3
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane, you can't keep doing this.</font>

4
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The last 17 occurrences
have been predictable to the second.</font>

5
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane, you're an astrophysicist,
not some storm chaser.</font>

6
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm telling you,
there's a connection</font>

7
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">between these atmospheric
disturbances and my research.</font>

8
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:52,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Erik, I wouldn't have asked you
to fly out here if I wasn't absolutely sure.</font>

9
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane?</font>

10
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you want to see this.</font>

11
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

12
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you said
it was a subtle aurora!</font>

13
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

14
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get closer.
- Right. Good one.</font>

15
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

16
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

17
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not dying for 6 college credits!</font>

18
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think
that was legally your fault.</font>

19
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the first aid Kit.</font>

20
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do me a favor and don't be dead.</font>

21
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

22
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did he come from?</font>

23
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once,</font>

24
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">mankind accepted a simple truth,</font>

25
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:46,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that they were not alone
in this universe.</font>

26
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:52,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some worlds man believed
to be home to their gods.</font>

27
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Others, they knew to fear.</font>

28
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:03,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From a realm of cold and darkness
came the Frost Giants,</font>

29
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">threatening to plunge the mortal world
into a new ice age.</font>

30
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:32,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But humanity
would not face this threat alone.</font>

31
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:13,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our armies drove the Frost Giants
back into the heart of their own world.</font>

32
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The cost was great.</font>

33
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the end,</font>

34
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">their king fell.</font>

35
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:31,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the source of their power
was taken from them.</font>

36
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With the last great war ended,</font>

37
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:38,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we withdrew from the other worlds
and returned home</font>

38
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the Realm Eternal,</font>

39
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Asgard</font>

40
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we remain as a beacon of hope,</font>

41
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">shining out across the stars.</font>

42
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And though we have fallen
into man's myths and legends,</font>

43
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it was Asgard</font>

44
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and its warriors</font>

45
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that brought peace</font>

46
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the universe.</font>

47
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the day will come</font>

48
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when one of you</font>

49
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will have to defend that peace.</font>

50
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do the Frost Giants still live?</font>

51
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I'm king,</font>

52
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll hunt the monsters down
and slay them all!</font>

53
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just as you did, Father.</font>

54
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A wise king</font>

55
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:05,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">never seeks out war.</font>

56
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he must always be ready for it.</font>

57
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm ready, Father.
- So am I.</font>

58
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only one of you can ascend
to the throne.</font>

59
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:34,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But both of you were born to be kings.</font>

60
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, please.</font>

61
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor Odinson,</font>

62
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my heir,</font>

63
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my firstborn.</font>

64
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:11,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So long entrusted with
the mighty hammer Mjolnir,</font>

65
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">forged in the heart of a dying star,</font>

66
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">its power has no equal,</font>

67
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a weapon to destroy</font>

68
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or as a tool to build.</font>

69
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Tis a fit companion for a king.</font>

70
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have defended Asgard</font>

71
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the lives of the innocent
across the Nine Realms</font>

72
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from the time of the great beginning.</font>

73
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Though the day has come...</font>

74
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you swear to guard
the Nine Realms?</font>

75
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear.</font>

76
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And do you swear
to preserve the peace?</font>

77
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear.</font>

78
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you swear</font>

79
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to cast aside all selfish ambition</font>

80
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and to pledge yourself only
to the good of the Realms?</font>

81
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear!</font>

82
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, on this day,</font>

83
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, Odin Allfather,</font>

84
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">proclaim you...</font>

85
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Frost Giants!</font>

86
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Jotuns must pay
for what they've done!</font>

87
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They have paid, with their lives.</font>

88
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Destroyer did its work,</font>

89
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Casket is safe, and all is well.</font>

90
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All is Well?</font>

91
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They broke into the weapons vault!</font>

92
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If the Frost Giants had stolen
even one of these relics...</font>

93
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They didn't.
- Well, I want to know why!</font>

94
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a truce with Laufey,
King of the Jotuns.</font>

95
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:03,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just broke your truce!
They know you are vulnerable!</font>

96
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What action would you take?</font>

97
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">March into Jotunheim as you once did.
Teach them a lesson.</font>

98
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Break their spirits</font>

99
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so they'll never dare
try to cross our borders again.</font>

100
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're thinking only as a warrior.</font>

101
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was an act of war!</font>

102
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was the act of but a few,
doomed to fail.</font>

103
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look how far they got!</font>

104
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will find the breach in our defenses
and it will be sealed.</font>

105
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As King of Asgard....</font>

106
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're not king!</font>

107
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not yer.</font>

108
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's unwise to be in my company
right now, Brother.</font>

109
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was to be my day of triumph.</font>

110
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll come.</font>

111
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In time.</font>

112
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's this?</font>

113
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it's any consolation,
I think you're right.</font>

114
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About the Frost Giants,
about Laufey, about everything.</font>

115
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If they found a way to penetrate
Asgard's defenses once,</font>

116
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who's to say they won't try again?</font>

117
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Next time with an army.
- Exactly.</font>

118
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing you can do
without defying Father.</font>

119
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. I know that look.</font>

120
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the only way
to ensure the safety of our borders.</font>

121
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor, it's madness.</font>

122
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madness? What sort of madness?</font>

123
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to Jotunheim.</font>

124
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

125
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't like a journey to Earth</font>

126
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where you summon
a little lightning and thunder,</font>

127
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the mortals worship you as a god.</font>

128
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Jotunheim.</font>

129
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father fought his way into Jotunheim,</font>

130
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">defeated their armies
and took their Casket.</font>

131
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We would just be looking for answers.</font>

132
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is forbidden!</font>

133
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friends, have you forgotten
all that we have done together?</font>

134
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fandral, Hogun.</font>

135
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who led you
into the most glorious of battles?</font>

136
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did.</font>

137
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Volstagg,
to delicacies so succulent,</font>

138
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you thought you'd died
and gone to Valhalla?</font>

139
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did.</font>

140
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

141
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who proved wrong
all who scoffed at the idea</font>

142
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that a young maiden could be
one of the fiercest warriors</font>

143
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this realm has ever known?</font>

144
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did.</font>

145
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">True, but I supported you, Sif.</font>

146
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friends,</font>

147
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we're going to Jotunheim.</font>

148
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You leave this to me.</font>

149
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good Heimdall...
- You're not dressed warmly enough.</font>

150
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry?</font>

151
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think that you can deceive me?</font>

152
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You must be mistaken...
- Enough!</font>

153
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heimdall, may we pass?</font>

154
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:57,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never has an enemy slipped my watch
until this day.</font>

155
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish to know how that happened.</font>

156
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then tell no one where we have gone
until we've returned.</font>

157
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Understand?</font>

158
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened?
Silver tongue turn to lead?</font>

159
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be warned.</font>

160
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:02,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will honor my sworn oath
to protect this realm as its Gatekeeper.</font>

161
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If your return
threatens the safety of Asgard,</font>

162
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bifrost will remain closed to you</font>

163
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you'll be left to die
in the cold waste of Jotunheim.</font>

164
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Couldn't you just
leave the bridge open for us?</font>

165
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To leave the bridge open</font>

166
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would unleash
the full power of the Bifrost</font>

167
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.</font>

168
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no plans to die today.</font>

169
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None do.</font>

170
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We shouldn't be here.</font>

171
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's move.</font>

172
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are they?</font>

173
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiding,</font>

174
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as cowards always do.</font>

175
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:34,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've come a long way to die,
Asgardians.</font>

176
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Thor Odinson!</font>

177
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We know who you are.</font>

178
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did your people get into Asgarol?</font>

179
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The House of Odin is full of traitors.</font>

180
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not dishonor my father's name
with your lies!</font>

181
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father is a murderer and a thief!</font>

182
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And why have you come here?
To make peace?</font>

183
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You long for battle. You crave it.</font>

184
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're nothing but a boy</font>

185
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">trying to prove himself a man.</font>

186
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, this "boy"
has grown tired of your mockery.</font>

187
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor, stop and think.</font>

188
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look around you, we're outnumbered.</font>

189
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Know your place, Brother.</font>

190
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:35,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know not
what your actions would unleash.</font>

191
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do.</font>

192
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:43,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go now, while I still allow it.</font>

193
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:58,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will accept your most gracious offer.</font>

194
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Brother.</font>

195
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run back home, little princess.</font>

196
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn.</font>

197
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next?</font>

198
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least make it a challenge for me!</font>

199
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's more like it.</font>

200
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let them touch you!</font>

201
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor!</font>

202
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We must go!
- Then go!</font>

203
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run!</font>

204
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor!</font>

205
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heimdall!</font>

206
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the bridge!</font>

207
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father! We'll finish them together!</font>

208
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Silence!</font>

209
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Allfather.</font>

210
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look weary.</font>

211
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laufey,</font>

212
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">end this now.</font>

213
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your boy sought this out.</font>

214
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right.</font>

215
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And these are the actions of a boy,
treat them as such.</font>

216
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:52,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and I can end this here and now,
before there's further bloodshed.</font>

217
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are beyond diplomacy now,
Allfather.</font>

218
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll get what he came for.</font>

219
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">War</font>

220
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and death.</font>

221
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So be it.</font>

222
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did you bring us back?</font>

223
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you realize what you've done?</font>

224
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What you've started?
- I was protecting my home.</font>

225
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You cannot even protect your friends!</font>

226
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can you hope
to protect a kingdom?</font>

227
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get him to the healing room! Now!</font>

228
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:43,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There won't be a kingdom
to protect if you're afraid to act.</font>

229
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:48,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Jotuns must learn to fear me,
just as they once feared you.</font>

230
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's pride and vanity talking,
not leadership.</font>

231
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:54,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've forgotten everything I taught you
about a warrior's patience.</font>

232
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:57,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While you wait and be patient,
the Nine Realms laugh at us.</font>

233
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The old ways are done.</font>

234
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd stand giving speeches
while Asgard falls.</font>

235
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:05,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are a vain, greedy, cruel boy!</font>

236
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you are an old man and a fool!</font>

237
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

238
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was a fool</font>

239
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to think you were ready.</font>

240
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father...</font>

241
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor Odinson,</font>

242
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you have betrayed
the express command of your king.</font>

243
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Through your arrogance and stupidity,</font>

244
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you've opened these peaceful realms
and innocent lives</font>

245
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:44,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the horror and desolation of war!</font>

246
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:54,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are unworthy of these realms!</font>

247
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:57,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're unworthy of your title!</font>

248
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're unworthy</font>

249
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:05,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the loved ones you have betrayed.</font>

250
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I now take from you your power!</font>

251
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the name of my father</font>

252
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and his father before,</font>

253
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, Odin Allfather, cast you out!</font>

254
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whosoever holds this hammer,
if he be worthy,</font>

255
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">shall possess the power of Thor.</font>

256
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think
that was legally your fault.</font>

257
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the first aid Kit.</font>

258
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do me a favor and don't be dead.</font>

259
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa. Does he need CPR?
Because I totally know CPR.</font>

260
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did he come from?</font>

261
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all right?</font>

262
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hammer?</font>

263
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hammer?</font>

264
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.
It's pretty obvious.</font>

265
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. Erik, look at this!</font>

266
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to move quickly
before this all changes.</font>

267
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane, we have to take him
to the hospital.</font>

268
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Father!
- He's fine, look at him.</font>

269
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heimdall! I know you can hear me!
Open the Bifrost!</font>

270
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hospital. You go, I'll stay.</font>

271
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You. What realm is this?</font>

272
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alfheim? Nornheim?</font>

273
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">New Mexico?</font>

274
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:07,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You dare threaten me, Thor,
with so puny a weapon?</font>

275
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? He was freaking me out!</font>

276
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next time
you decide to taser somebody,</font>

277
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">make sure he's already in the car, okay?</font>

278
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane! Come on.</font>

279
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Name?</font>

280
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said it was Thor?</font>

281
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:47,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">T-H-O-R.</font>

282
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And your relationship to him?
- I've never met him before.</font>

283
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:51,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until she hit him with a car.</font>

284
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:54,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I grazed him, but she tasered him.</font>

285
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I did.</font>

286
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

287
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:01,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just taking a little blood.</font>

288
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How dare you attack the son of Odin?</font>

289
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need some help!</font>

290
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call security!</font>

291
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Security to ER 3, stat!</font>

292
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're no match for the Mighty...</font>

293
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:20,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh.</font>

294
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't think
this was just a magnetic storm, do you?</font>

295
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:34,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, the lensing around these edges</font>

296
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is characteristic
of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.</font>

297
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A what?</font>

298
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I thought you were a science major?
- Political science.</font>

299
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was the only applicant.</font>

300
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An Einstein-Rosen Bridge
is a theoretical connection</font>

301
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">between two different points
of space-time.</font>

302
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a wormhole.</font>

303
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Erik, look. What do you see?
- Stars.</font>

304
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but not our stars.</font>

305
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:56,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, this is the star alignment
for our quadrant this time of year,</font>

306
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and unless Ursa Minor decided
to take a day off,</font>

307
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">these are
someone else's constellations.</font>

308
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Check this out.</font>

309
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it can't be.</font>

310
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I left something at the hospital.</font>

311
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not possible!</font>

312
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was on drugs or something.
He just went nuts.</font>

313
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

314
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just lost
my most important piece of evidence.</font>

315
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:07,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Typical.</font>

316
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So now what?
- We find him.</font>

317
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you see what he did in there?</font>

318
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure finding him is the best idea.</font>

319
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, our data can't tell us
what it was like to be inside that event,</font>

320
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he can. So, we're gonna find him.</font>

321
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:19,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

322
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we're gonna look
all over New Mexico, right?</font>

323
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly.</font>

324
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

325
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:33,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry.
I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.</font>

326
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it, I got it.</font>

327
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, kick it in now!</font>

328
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did it Work?</font>

329
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, we found it.</font>

330
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, for a crazy homeless person,
he's pretty cut.</font>

331
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, sorry I tased you!</font>

332
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, excuse me!</font>

333
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this?</font>

334
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

335
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My ex.</font>

336
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:15,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good with patients
and bad with relationships.</font>

337
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're the only clothes I had
that would fit you.</font>

338
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They will suffice.</font>

339
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome.</font>

340
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This mortal form has grown weak.</font>

341
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need sustenance.</font>

342
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should never have let him go.</font>

343
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was no stopping him.</font>

344
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, at least
he's only banished, not dead.</font>

345
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is what we'd all be</font>

346
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if that guard hadn't told Odin
where we'd gone.</font>

347
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did the guard even know?</font>

348
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told him.</font>

349
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

350
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told him to go to Odin after we'd left.</font>

351
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He should be flogged for taking so long.</font>

352
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should never have
reached Jotunheim.</font>

353
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You told the guard?</font>

354
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saved our lives.</font>

355
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Thor's.</font>

356
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had no idea Father would banish him
for what he did.</font>

357
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:20,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loki.</font>

358
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must go to the Allfather
and convince him to change his mind.</font>

359
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if I do, then what?</font>

360
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:30,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love Thor more dearly than any of you,
but you know what he is.</font>

361
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's arrogant.
He's reckless. He's dangerous.</font>

362
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saw how he was today.</font>

363
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that what Asgard needs from its king?</font>

364
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:46,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He may speak of the good of Asgard,
but he's always been jealous of Thor.</font>

365
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should be grateful to him,
he saved our lives.</font>

366
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laufey said</font>

367
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there were traitors in the House of Odin.</font>

368
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A master of magic
could bring three Jotuns into Asgard.</font>

369
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loki's always been one for mischief,</font>

370
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you're talking
about something else entirely.</font>

371
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!</font>

372
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I cursed?</font>

373
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

374
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I?</font>

375
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're my son.</font>

376
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What more than that?</font>

377
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Casket wasn't the only thing
you took from Jotunheim that day,</font>

378
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was it?</font>

379
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

380
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the aftermath of the battle,</font>

381
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I went into the temple
and I found a baby.</font>

382
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:24,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Small for a giant's offspring.</font>

383
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Abandoned, suffering, left to die.</font>

384
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laufey's son.</font>

385
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laufey's son.</font>

386
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

387
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:42,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

388
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were knee-deep in Jotun blood,
why would you take me?</font>

389
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were an innocent child.</font>

390
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:52,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You took me for a purpose.
What was it?</font>

391
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me!</font>

392
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought
we could unite our kingdoms one day.</font>

393
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring about an alliance,
bring about permanent peace.</font>

394
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Through you.</font>

395
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

396
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But those plans no longer matter.</font>

397
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I am no more
than another stolen relic,</font>

398
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">locked up here
until you might have use of me.</font>

399
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you twist my words?</font>

400
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could have told me what I was
from the beginning,</font>

401
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:24,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">why didn't you?</font>

402
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're my son.</font>

403
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted only to protect you
from the truth.</font>

404
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I'm the monster</font>

405
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">parents tell their children about
at night?</font>

406
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, no.
- You know, it all makes sense now!</font>

407
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why you favored Thor all these years!</font>

408
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because no matter how much
you claim to love me,</font>

409
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you could never have a Frost Giant
sitting on the throne of Asgard!</font>

410
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guards!</font>

411
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guards, please, help!</font>

412
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you get inside that cloud?</font>

413
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, how could you eat
an entire box of Pop-Tarts</font>

414
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and still be this hungry?</font>

415
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This drink, I like it.
- I know. It's great, right?</font>

416
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Another!</font>

417
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.</font>

418
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What was that?
- It was delicious. I want another.</font>

419
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, you could have just said so.
- I just did.</font>

420
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, I mean, ask nicely.
- I meant no disrespect.</font>

421
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:46,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Well, no more smashing.</font>

422
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deal?</font>

423
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:51,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have my word.</font>

424
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

425
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The usual, please, Izzy.</font>

426
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You missed all the excitement
out at the crater.</font>

427
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're saying some kind
of satellite landed out in the desert.</font>

428
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we were having
a good time with it</font>

429
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until the Feds showed up.</font>

430
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.
Did you say there was a satellite crash?</font>

431
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:11,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

432
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. This is going on Facebook.
Smile.</font>

433
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did it look like, the satellite?</font>

434
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know anything about satellites,
but it was heavy.</font>

435
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:26,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, nobody could lift it.</font>

436
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They said it was radioactive.
I had my hands all over it.</font>

437
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which way?</font>

438
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">50 miles west of here.</font>

439
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I wouldn't waste my time!</font>

440
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looked like the whole Army
was coming when we left.</font>

441
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbass!</font>

442
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you going?</font>

443
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 50 miles west of here.
- Why?</font>

444
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:53,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- To get what belongs to me.
- Oh, so you own a satellite now?</font>

445
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not what they say it is.</font>

446
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:55,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, whatever it is,</font>

447
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:56,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the government seems to think
it's theirs.</font>

448
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:58,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you just intend to go in there
and take it?</font>

449
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

450
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you take me there now,</font>

451
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell you everything you wish to know.</font>

452
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Everything?
- Yes.</font>

453
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:09,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the answers you seek will be yours
once I reclaim Mjolnir.</font>

454
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Myeu-muh? What's Myeu-muh?</font>

455
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:13,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I have a word, Jane?</font>

456
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't do this.</font>

457
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saw what I saw last night.</font>

458
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is no coincidence.
We have to find out what's in that crater.</font>

459
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm not talking about the crater,
I'm talking about him.</font>

460
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:28,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But he's promising us the answers.
- He's delusional.</font>

461
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to what he's saying.</font>

462
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:33,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's talking about Mjolnir
and Thor and Bifrost.</font>

463
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the stories I grew up with as a child.</font>

464
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just going to drive him. That's it.</font>

465
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's dangerous, Jane.</font>

466
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:49,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, but I can't take you.</font>

467
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then this is where we say goodbye.</font>

468
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

469
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you?</font>

470
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane Foster,</font>

471
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:07,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Erik Selvig,</font>

472
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darcy,</font>

473
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">farewell.</font>

474
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

475
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back to work.</font>

476
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

477
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my stuff!</font>

478
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is going on here?</font>

479
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Foster,
I'm Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.</font>

480
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that supposed to mean something
to me?</font>

481
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:51,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You can't do this!
- Jane!</font>

482
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane, this is a lot more serious
than you realize. Let it go.</font>

483
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let it go? This is my life.</font>

484
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:59,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're investigating a security threat.</font>

485
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to appropriate your records
and all your atmospheric data.</font>

486
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By "appropriate," do you mean steal?</font>

487
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:06,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, this should
more than compensate you</font>

488
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for your trouble.</font>

489
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't just buy replacements
at Radio Shack,</font>

490
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I made most of this equipment myself!</font>

491
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I'm sure you can do it again.</font>

492
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:16,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm sure I can sue you
for violating my constitutional rights!</font>

493
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:18,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Ms. Foster,
but we're the good guys.</font>

494
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:21,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So are we!</font>

495
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:24,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm on the verge of understanding
something extraordinary.</font>

496
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And everything I know
about this phenomenon</font>

497
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is either in this lab or in this book.</font>

498
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you can't just take this away... Hey!</font>

499
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane! Easy! Easy. Jane...</font>

500
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for your cooperation.</font>

501
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Years of research,</font>

502
00:46:58,858 --> 00:46:59,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">gone.</font>

503
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They even took my iPod.</font>

504
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:05,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the backups?
They took our backups.</font>

505
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:09,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They took the backups of our backups.
They were extremely thorough.</font>

506
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just downloaded, like,
30 songs onto there.</font>

507
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could you please stop with your iPod?</font>

508
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are these people?</font>

509
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew this scientist.</font>

510
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The pioneer in gamma radiation.</font>

511
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.H.I.E.L.D. showed up</font>

512
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he wasn't heard from again.</font>

513
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:33,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not gonna do that to us.
I'm gonna get everything back.</font>

514
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:36,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, please.
Let me contact one of my colleagues.</font>

515
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's had some dealings
with these people before.</font>

516
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:41,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll e-mail him and maybe he can help.</font>

517
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They took your laptop, too.</font>

518
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Allfather,
we must speak with you urgently.</font>

519
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friends.</font>

520
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Odin?</font>

521
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:15,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father has fallen into the Odinsleep.</font>

522
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mother fears
he may never awaken again.</font>

523
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:21,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We would speak with her.</font>

524
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:24,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She has refused to leave
my father's bedside.</font>

525
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:29,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can bring your urgent matter to me.</font>

526
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:38,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your king.</font>

527
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:54,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My King, we would ask
that you end Thor's banishment.</font>

528
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My first command
cannot be to undo the Allfather's last.</font>

529
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're on the brink of war
with Jotunheim.</font>

530
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our people need a sense of continuity,</font>

531
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in order to feel safe
in these difficult times.</font>

532
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of us must stand together</font>

533
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the good of Asgard.</font>

534
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, of course.</font>

535
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good. Then you will wait for my word.
- If I may</font>

536
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:33,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">beg the indulgence of Your Majesty
to perhaps reconsider...</font>

537
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:34,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're done!</font>

538
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:39,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a horse!</font>

539
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:45,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't have horses.
Just dogs, cats, birds...</font>

540
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then give me one of those
large enough to ride.</font>

541
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:49,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you still need a lift?</font>

542
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never done anything like this before.</font>

543
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:02,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever done
anything like this before?</font>

544
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Many times.</font>

545
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're brave to do it.</font>

546
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, they just stole
my entire life's work.</font>

547
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:11,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't really have much left to lose.</font>

548
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but you're clever.</font>

549
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:17,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Far more clever than anyone else
in this realm.</font>

550
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Realm"? "Realm"?</font>

551
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:23,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You think me strange.
- Yeah, I do.</font>

552
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good strange or bad strange?</font>

553
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not quite sure yet.</font>

554
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

555
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But who are you?</font>

556
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

557
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:48,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll see soon enough.</font>

558
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You promised me answers.</font>

559
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you seek, it's a bridge.</font>

560
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?</font>

561
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More like a Rainbow Bridge.</font>

562
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I hope you're not crazy.</font>

563
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:18,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never get used to seeing him like this.</font>

564
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:22,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's put it off for so long now,
that I fear...</font>

565
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long will it last?</font>

566
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:31,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. This time it's different.
We were unprepared.</font>

567
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So why did he lie?</font>

568
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:40,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He kept the truth from you
so that you would never feel different.</font>

569
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are our son, Loki,</font>

570
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we, your family.</font>

571
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:51,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We mustn't lose hope
that your father will return to us.</font>

572
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your brother.</font>

573
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What hope is there for Thor?</font>

574
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:01,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's always a purpose
to everything your father does.</font>

575
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's no satellite crash!</font>

576
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They would have hauled
the wreckage away,</font>

577
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they wouldn't have built a city around it.</font>

578
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're going to need this.
- What? Wait, why?</font>

579
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now stay here.</font>

580
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:52,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once I have Mjolnir, I will return
the items they've stolen from you.</font>

581
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:53,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deal?</font>

582
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Look what's down there.</font>

583
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you're just gonna walk in,
grab our stuff and walk out?</font>

584
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I'm going to fly out.</font>

585
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:12,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, feed from the keyhole
can barely penetrate the cloud cover.</font>

586
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:13,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tech's barely working as it is,</font>

587
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with all the interference
that thing's giving off.</font>

588
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we've got a commercial aircraft
coming right over us.</font>

589
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:22,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Southwest Airlines, flight 5434.</font>

590
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reroute it like all the others.</font>

591
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:25,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold a sec.</font>

592
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got something outside the fence,
west side.</font>

593
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:32,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Delancey, Jackson.
West side perimeter Go check it out.</font>

594
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:35,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There it is.</font>

595
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Delancey, Jackson. Report.</font>

596
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Agent down.
We've got a perimeter breach.</font>

597
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:13,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've reached Dr Erik Selvig.
Please leave me a message.</font>

598
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:17,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Erik, it's me. Don't worry, I'm fine,</font>

599
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but just in case
you don't hear from me in the next hour,</font>

600
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just come by the crater site
and try and find me, okay?</font>

601
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did exactly what you told me not to.
I'm sorry.</font>

602
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So sorry. Bye.</font>

603
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bravo quadrant, move!</font>

604
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:47,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Entering south tunnel!</font>

605
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Negative, negative.
I have no comms.</font>

606
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Target sighted, east tunnel!</font>

607
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need eyes up high, with a gun.</font>

608
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Moving north!</font>

609
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have we got?</font>

610
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:46,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a massive
electromagnetic surge</font>

611
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">coming off that thing.</font>

612
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Systems are barely coping.</font>

613
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Barton? Talk to me.</font>

614
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want me to slow him down, sir?</font>

615
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:58,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or are you sending in more guys
for him to beat up?</font>

616
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll let you know.</font>

617
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're big.</font>

618
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fought bigger.</font>

619
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better call it, Coulson,
'cause I'm starting to root for this guy.</font>

620
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:28,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last chance, sir.</font>

621
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. I want to see this.</font>

622
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:42,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, show's over.
Ground units, move in.</font>

623
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:37,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He committed a crime. He's in jail!</font>

624
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't just leave him there!
Why?</font>

625
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't see what I saw!</font>

626
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look!
Look, it's Myeu-muh.</font>

627
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:50,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where'd you find this?</font>

628
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:51,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The children's section.</font>

629
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:54,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wanted to show you
how silly his story was.</font>

630
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're the one
who's always pushing me</font>

631
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:58,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to chase down every possibility,
every alternative!</font>

632
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm talking about science, not magic!</font>

633
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:03,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, magic's just science
that we don't understand yet.</font>

634
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:05,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Arthur C. Clarke.
- Who wrote science fiction.</font>

635
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:08,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A precursor to science fact!
- In some cases, yeah.</font>

636
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if there is
an Einstein-Rosen Bridge,</font>

637
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then there's something
on the other side.</font>

638
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And advanced beings
could have crossed it!</font>

639
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane.</font>

640
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A primitive culture like the Vikings
might have worshipped them as deities.</font>

641
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! Yes, exactly. Thank you.</font>

642
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm-hmm.</font>

643
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:28,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You made my men,</font>

644
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">some of the most
highly trained professionals in the world,</font>

645
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:33,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">look like a bunch of minimum-wage
mall cops.</font>

646
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:36,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's hurtful.</font>

647
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:41,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In my experience, it takes someone
who's received similar training</font>

648
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:42,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to do what you did to them.</font>

649
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:47,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you tell me
where you received your training?</font>

650
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:51,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?</font>

651
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you strike me
more as the soldier of fortune type.</font>

652
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:59,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where was it? South Africa?</font>

653
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:04,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Certain groups pay very well
for a good mercenary like you.</font>

654
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:08,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

655
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One way or another,
we find out what we need to know.</font>

656
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're good at that.</font>

657
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't go anywhere.</font>

658
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:33,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loki! What are you doing here?</font>

659
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:35,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to see you.</font>

660
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's happened?</font>

661
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me. Is it Jotunheim?</font>

662
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:42,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me explain to Father.</font>

663
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father is dead.</font>

664
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:51,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

665
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your banishment,</font>

666
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the threat of a new war,</font>

667
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:00,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it was too much for him to bear.</font>

668
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mustn't blame yourself.</font>

669
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:07,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that you loved him.</font>

670
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried to tell him so,
but he wouldn't listen.</font>

671
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was so cruel
to put the hammer within your reach,</font>

672
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:18,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">knowing that you could never lift it.</font>

673
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The burden of the throne
has fallen to me now.</font>

674
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:32,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I come home?</font>

675
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The truce with Jotunheim
is conditional upon your exile.</font>

676
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:42,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, but couldn't we find a way...
- And Mother has forbidden your return.</font>

677
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is goodbye, Brother.</font>

678
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry.</font>

679
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:58,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

680
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am sorry.</font>

681
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for coming here.</font>

682
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Farewell.</font>

683
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodbye.</font>

684
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good bye?</font>

685
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just got back.</font>

686
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:10,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir?</font>

687
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:12,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got a visitor.</font>

688
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His name is Donald Blake?</font>

689
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Donald Blake.</font>

690
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have dangerous coworkers,
Dr. Selvig.</font>

691
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:27,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was distraught when he found out
that you've taken all our research.</font>

692
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was years of his life, gone!</font>

693
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can understand
how a man could go off like that.</font>

694
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A big, faceless organization like yours</font>

695
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:39,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">coming in with their
jackbooted thugs and...</font>

696
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how he put it.</font>

697
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:44,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That still doesn't explain</font>

698
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how he managed
to tear through our security.</font>

699
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:49,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steroids! He's a bit of a fitness nut.</font>

700
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:52,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir?</font>

701
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:58,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It says here that he's an M.D.</font>

702
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:01,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he is! Or he was.</font>

703
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He switched careers
and became a physicist.</font>

704
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:05,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A brilliant physicist.</font>

705
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a wonderful man.
He's a man in pain.</font>

706
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Donny, Donny, Donny!</font>

707
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:18,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you are. You're gonna be all right.
I'm taking you home now.</font>

708
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:33,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Selvig!</font>

709
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just keep him away from the bars.</font>

710
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will!</font>

711
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:44,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where are we going?
- To get a drink.</font>

712
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow them.</font>

713
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:54,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I had it all backwards.</font>

714
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:57,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had it all wrong.</font>

715
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:04,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a bad thing finding out
that you don't have all the answers.</font>

716
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You start asking the right questions.</font>

717
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:15,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the first time in my life,</font>

718
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:20,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.</font>

719
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone who's ever going to
find his way in this world</font>

720
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:27,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has to start by admitting
he doesn't know where the hell he is.</font>

721
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:30,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for what you've done.</font>

722
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:33,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, don't thank me. I only did it for Jane.</font>

723
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her father and I
taught at university together.</font>

724
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was a good man.</font>

725
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:41,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He never listened.</font>

726
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neither did I.</font>

727
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father
was trying to teach me something,</font>

728
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I was too stupid to see it.</font>

729
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:54,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know if you're delusional
or if you're pulling some kind of con,</font>

730
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care.</font>

731
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:57,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just care about her.</font>

732
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've seen the way she looks at you.</font>

733
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear to you, I mean her no harm.</font>

734
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

735
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:13,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In that case, I'll buy you another round,
and you leave town tonight.</font>

736
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:20,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two boilermakers.</font>

737
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:13,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kill him.</font>

738
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After all I've done for you?</font>

739
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:24,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're the one
who showed us the way into Asgard.</font>

740
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:26,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was just a bit of fun, really.</font>

741
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:30,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To ruin my brother's big day.</font>

742
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:35,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And to protect the realm
from his idiotic rule for a while longer.</font>

743
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will hear you.</font>

744
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:47,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will conceal you
and a handful of your soldiers,</font>

745
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:52,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lead you into Odin's chambers,
and you can slay him where he lies.</font>

746
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:54,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not kill him yourself?</font>

747
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suspect that the Asgardians
would not take kindly</font>

748
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:01,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to a king who had murdered
his predecessor.</font>

749
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:06,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once Odin is dead,
I will return the Casket to you</font>

750
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:11,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you can return Jotunheim to all its...</font>

751
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:15,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Glory.</font>

752
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Accept.</font>

753
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:28,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What troubles you, Gatekeeper?</font>

754
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:34,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim,
but could neither see you nor hear you.</font>

755
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:36,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were shrouded from me,</font>

756
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like the Frost Giants
that entered this realm.</font>

757
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps your senses have weakened
after your many years of service.</font>

758
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or perhaps someone has found a way</font>

759
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:46,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to hide that
which he does not wish me to see.</font>

760
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:50,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have great power, Heimdall.</font>

761
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did Odin ever fear you?</font>

762
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- And why is that?</font>

763
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:01,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because he is my king
and I am sworn to obey him.</font>

764
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:06,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was your king
and you're sworn to obey me now.</font>

765
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:07,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>

766
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:14,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

767
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you will open the Bifrost to no one</font>

768
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until I have repaired the damage
that my brother has done.</font>

769
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:37,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. Is he okay?</font>

770
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:40,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's fine. Not injured at all.</font>

771
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, my friend.</font>

772
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:44,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What happened?
- We drank, we fought,</font>

773
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he made his ancestors proud.</font>

774
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:48,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put him on the bed.</font>

775
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:03,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still don't think
you're the God of Thunder.</font>

776
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:06,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you ought to be.</font>

777
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are these your chambers?</font>

778
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:22,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's more of a temporary living situation.</font>

779
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:27,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I don't usually have guests.</font>

780
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:30,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, I never have guests.</font>

781
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not the right place for it.</font>

782
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:37,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

783
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we go outside?</font>

784
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:44,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, of course.</font>

785
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:52,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I come up here sometimes
when I can't sleep</font>

786
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:56,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or I'm trying to reconcile particle data,
or when Darcy's driving me crazy.</font>

787
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:00,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I come up here a lot, actually,
now that I think about it.</font>

788
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:06,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm really glad you're safe.</font>

789
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've been very kind to me,</font>

790
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I've been far less grateful
than you deserve.</font>

791
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I hit you with my car
a couple times,</font>

792
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:17,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I think that kind of evens things out.</font>

793
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:21,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps I had it coming.</font>

794
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:28,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

795
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't believe it!</font>

796
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:35,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was all I could get back.
I'm sorry it's not as much as I promised.</font>

797
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:39,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, this is great! This is...
I don't have to start from scratch now.</font>

798
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

799
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:47,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong?</font>

800
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:50,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.H.l.E.L.D.</font>

801
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever they are,</font>

802
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:54,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they're gonna do
everything in their power</font>

803
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:57,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to make sure this research
never sees the light of day.</font>

804
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:58,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Jane.</font>

805
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to me. You must not give up.</font>

806
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You must finish what you've started.
- Why?</font>

807
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you're right.</font>

808
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:07,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, look.</font>

809
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:13,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your ancestors called it magic,
and you call it science.</font>

810
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I come from a place
where they're one and the same thing.</font>

811
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

812
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:37,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father explained it to me like this,</font>

813
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:38,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that your world</font>

814
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:41,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is one of the Nine Realms
of the Cosmos,</font>

815
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:44,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">linked to each other
by the branches of Yggdrasil,</font>

816
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:47,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Worlds Tree.</font>

817
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you see it every day
without realizing.</font>

818
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:53,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The images glimpsed through...
What did you call it?</font>

819
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This Hooble Telescope.</font>

820
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:59,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hubble.
- Hubble Telescope.</font>

821
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me more.</font>

822
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:05,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, the Nine Realms.</font>

823
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, there is Midgard, which is Earth.</font>

824
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:10,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Alfheim.</font>

825
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:13,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vanaheim. Jotunheim.</font>

826
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:15,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Asgard.</font>

827
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:18,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's where I come from.</font>

828
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:36,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Jane.</font>

829
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:43,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our dearest friend banished,
Loki on the throne,</font>

830
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:46,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Asgard on the brink of war,
yet you've managed to consume</font>

831
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:50,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">four wild boar,
six pheasant, a side of beef,</font>

832
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:53,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and two casks of ale. Shame on you.
Don't you care?</font>

833
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not mistake my appetite for apathy!</font>

834
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it, both of you!</font>

835
01:15:58,888 --> 01:15:59,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

836
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:03,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We all know what we have to do.
- We must go.</font>

837
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must find Thor.</font>

838
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:10,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's treason.</font>

839
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To hell with treason, it's suicide.</font>

840
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor would do the same for us.</font>

841
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:17,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now shush.</font>

842
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:21,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heimdall might be watching.</font>

843
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heimdall demands your presence.</font>

844
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're doomed.</font>

845
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:38,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You would defy the commands of Loki,
our king,</font>

846
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:41,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">break every oath you
have taken as warriors,</font>

847
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and commit treason to bring Thor back?</font>

848
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:45,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- Good.</font>

849
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:47,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you'll help us?</font>

850
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:52,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am bound by honor to our king.
I cannot open the bridge to you.</font>

851
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:54,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Complicated fellow, isn't he?</font>

852
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:56,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now what do we do?</font>

853
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look!</font>

854
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:20,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the hell was that?
- I don't know, sir.</font>

855
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:21,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got massive energy readings
out of nowhere</font>

856
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then they just disappeared.
15 miles due northwest.</font>

857
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:25,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go take a look.</font>

858
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:51,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

859
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.</font>

860
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:03,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Base to Team 2,
we've got activity outside the town.</font>

861
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:04,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay on your target.</font>

862
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:16,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ensure my brother does not return.</font>

863
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:22,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Destroy everything.</font>

864
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom?</font>

865
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:44,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there a Renaissance Fair in town?</font>

866
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:45,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call it in.</font>

867
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:47,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

868
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:52,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Base, we've got Xena, Jackie Chan
and Robin Hood.</font>

869
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a beautiful theory, Jane.</font>

870
01:18:56,482 --> 01:18:59,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you won't be able to convince
the scientific community of any of it.</font>

871
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:01,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not without hard evidence.</font>

872
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:03,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Found you!</font>

873
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friends!</font>

874
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:14,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is good! This is good.</font>

875
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:16,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't believe it.</font>

876
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:19,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, excuse me.
Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.</font>

877
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:23,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friends,</font>

878
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:26,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never been happier to see anyone.</font>

879
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:28,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you should not have come.</font>

880
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're here to take you home.</font>

881
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:34,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I can't go home.</font>

882
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:38,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father</font>

883
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:40,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is dead because of me.</font>

884
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I must remain in exile.</font>

885
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:45,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor,</font>

886
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your father still lives.</font>

887
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:05,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me, Loki,
how did you get the Jotuns into Asgarol?</font>

888
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:09,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think the Bifrost is the only way
in and out of this realm?</font>

889
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:10,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are secret paths
between the worlds</font>

890
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:13,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to which even you, with all your gifts,
are blind.</font>

891
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:16,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I have need of them no longer,
now that I am king.</font>

892
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I say, for your act of treason,</font>

893
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:21,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you are relieved of your duties
as Gatekeeper,</font>

894
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:23,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and no longer citizen of Asgard.</font>

895
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:26,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I need no longer obey you.</font>

896
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:50,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get somebody from Linguistics
down here.</font>

897
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was somebody else coming?</font>

898
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:24,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that one of Stark's?</font>

899
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:27,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.
The guy never tells me anything.</font>

900
01:21:31,678 --> 01:21:32,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

901
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are using
unregistered weapons technology.</font>

902
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:36,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Identify yourself</font>

903
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:41,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>

904
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:46,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Incoming!</font>

905
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:55,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane, you have to leave.</font>

906
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:57,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you gonna do?
- I'm staying here.</font>

907
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor's going to fight with us!</font>

908
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friends,</font>

909
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:05,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just a man. I'll only be in the way,
or worse, get one of you killed.</font>

910
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I can help
get these people to safety.</font>

911
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if you're staying, then so am I.</font>

912
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:12,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We'll need some time.
- You'll have it!</font>

913
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:14,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, move it, people!</font>

914
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody out! Use the back door.</font>

915
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:19,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, hurry! You can eat later.</font>

916
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:34,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep it distracted.</font>

917
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:51,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For Asgard!</font>

918
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fall back!</font>

919
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:45,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. Now. Run!</font>

920
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:16,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sif. Sif, you've done all you can.</font>

921
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:19,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I will die a warrior's death.</font>

922
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:21,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stories will be told of this day.</font>

923
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:24,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Live, and tell those stories yourself.</font>

924
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:28,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now go.</font>

925
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:38,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must return to Asgard.
You have to stop Loki.</font>

926
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:40,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about you?</font>

927
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:43,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not worry, my friends. I have a plan.</font>

928
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:45,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

929
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:51,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to fall back. Come on.</font>

930
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:52,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

931
01:25:00,387 --> 01:25:01,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait!</font>

932
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:10,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's he doing?</font>

933
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:41,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brother,
whatever I have done to wrong you,</font>

934
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:44,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whatever I have done
to lead you to do this,</font>

935
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:46,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am truly sorry.</font>

936
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But these people are innocent.</font>

937
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:54,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Taking their lives will gain you nothing.</font>

938
01:26:01,865 --> 01:26:03,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So take mine</font>

939
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:05,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and end this.</font>

940
01:26:19,466 --> 01:26:20,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

941
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:37,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's over.</font>

942
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:40,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. it's not over.</font>

943
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:43,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you're safe.</font>

944
01:26:43,407 --> 01:26:45,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're safe.</font>

945
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:46,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's over.</font>

946
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:54,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

947
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:13,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

948
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:41,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're spiking.
Levels increase!</font>

949
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:43,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whosoever holds this hammer,</font>

950
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:47,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if he be worthy,</font>

951
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:52,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">shall possess the power of Thor.</font>

952
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:09,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane!</font>

953
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:14,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No. No. No!
- Come!</font>

954
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:39,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. My. God.</font>

955
01:29:48,675 --> 01:29:50,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, is this how you normally look?</font>

956
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:51,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More or less.</font>

957
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:54,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good look.</font>

958
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:58,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must go to the Bifrost site.
I would have words with my brother.</font>

959
01:29:58,184 --> 01:29:59,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me!</font>

960
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:04,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Donald?</font>

961
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:07,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think
you've been completely honest with me.</font>

962
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:08,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Know this, Son of Coul.</font>

963
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:11,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and I, we fight for the same cause,
the protection of this world.</font>

964
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:13,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From this day forward,
you can count me as your ally</font>

965
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:16,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you return the items
you have taken from Jane.</font>

966
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:18,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stolen.
- Borrowed.</font>

967
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:21,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course,
you can have your equipment back.</font>

968
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:23,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna need it
to continue your research.</font>

969
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:26,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like to see
the bridge we spoke of?</font>

970
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:29,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

971
01:30:30,884 --> 01:30:32,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, I need to debrief you!</font>

972
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:41,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to Asgard.</font>

973
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:09,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heimdall, open the Bifrost.</font>

974
01:31:16,846 --> 01:31:18,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heimdall?</font>

975
01:31:22,352 --> 01:31:23,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heimdall!</font>

976
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:27,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't answer.</font>

977
01:31:27,941 --> 01:31:29,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we are stranded.</font>

978
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:32,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heimdall!
If you can hear me, we need you now!</font>

979
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:36,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heimdall! We need you now!</font>

980
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:43,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heimdall!</font>

981
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:01,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must go back to Asgard,
but I give you my word,</font>

982
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:05,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will return for you.</font>

983
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:13,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deal?</font>

984
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:28,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deal.</font>

985
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:47,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get him to the healing room!</font>

986
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:50,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave my brother to me.</font>

987
01:33:15,173 --> 01:33:16,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's said</font>

988
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:21,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you can still hear and see
what transpires around you.</font>

989
01:33:23,014 --> 01:33:25,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope it's true,</font>

990
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:29,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so that you may know</font>

991
01:33:30,188 --> 01:33:34,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your death came at the hand</font>

992
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:36,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of Laufey.</font>

993
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:48,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your death came
by the son of Odin.</font>

994
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:55,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loki!</font>

995
01:33:55,338 --> 01:33:56,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saved him!</font>

996
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:03,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear to you, Mother,</font>

997
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:06,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that they will pay for what
they've done today.</font>

998
01:34:06,516 --> 01:34:07,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loki.</font>

999
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:09,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor!</font>

1000
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:12,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew you'd return to us.</font>

1001
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:19,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you tell her</font>

1002
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:23,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how you sent the Destroyer
to kill our friends, to kill me?</font>

1003
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:24,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1004
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:26,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why, it must have been enforcing
Father's last command.</font>

1005
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:29,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a talented liar, Brother.
Always have been.</font>

1006
01:34:30,248 --> 01:34:31,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good to have you back.</font>

1007
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:35,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to destroy Jotunheim.</font>

1008
01:35:17,086 --> 01:35:18,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't stop it.</font>

1009
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:21,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Bifrost will build until
it rips Jotunheim apart.</font>

1010
01:35:43,696 --> 01:35:44,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane?</font>

1011
01:35:46,824 --> 01:35:48,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why have you done this?</font>

1012
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:52,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To prove to Father
that I am the worthy son.</font>

1013
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:55,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When he wakes,
I will have saved his life.</font>

1014
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:58,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will have destroyed that
race of monsters.</font>

1015
01:35:58,127 --> 01:36:00,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I will be true heir to the throne!</font>

1016
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:02,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't kill an entire race!</font>

1017
01:36:02,715 --> 01:36:04,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

1018
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:10,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what is this newfound love
for the Frost Giants?</font>

1019
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:14,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could have killed them all
with your bare hands.</font>

1020
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:16,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I've changed.
- So have I.</font>

1021
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:19,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now fight me.</font>

1022
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never wanted the throne!</font>

1023
01:36:26,114 --> 01:36:27,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I only ever wanted to be your equal.</font>

1024
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:30,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will not fight you, Brother!</font>

1025
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:32,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not your brother.</font>

1026
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:34,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never was.</font>

1027
01:36:34,414 --> 01:36:35,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loki, this is madness.</font>

1028
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:38,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it madness?</font>

1029
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it?</font>

1030
01:36:41,546 --> 01:36:42,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it?</font>

1031
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:47,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. What happened to you
on Earth that turned you so soft?</font>

1032
01:36:48,678 --> 01:36:51,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't tell me it was that woman.</font>

1033
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:52,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

1034
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:54,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was!</font>

1035
01:36:54,684 --> 01:36:58,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe, when we're finished here,
I'll pay her a visit myself!</font>

1036
01:37:41,147 --> 01:37:43,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor!</font>

1037
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:51,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brother, please.</font>

1038
01:38:02,835 --> 01:38:04,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enough!</font>

1039
01:38:47,797 --> 01:38:48,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at you,</font>

1040
01:38:51,634 --> 01:38:52,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Mighty Thor,</font>

1041
01:38:56,055 --> 01:38:58,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with all your strength,</font>

1042
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:01,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and what good does it do you now, huh?</font>

1043
01:39:02,895 --> 01:39:06,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you hear me, Brother?
There's nothing you can do!</font>

1044
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:25,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

1045
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:31,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you destroy the bridge,
you'll never see her again!</font>

1046
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:42,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive me, Jane.</font>

1047
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:22,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could have done it, Father!</font>

1048
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:25,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could have done it!</font>

1049
01:40:26,103 --> 01:40:27,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For you!</font>

1050
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:29,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For all of us!</font>

1051
01:40:31,817 --> 01:40:33,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">NO, Loki.</font>

1052
01:40:41,911 --> 01:40:42,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loki, no.</font>

1053
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:46,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1054
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:51,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1055
01:41:08,104 --> 01:41:09,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's gone.</font>

1056
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:24,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then, with a mighty bellow,</font>

1057
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:29,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I flew into the giant metal creature
and laid him low!</font>

1058
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:32,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that another way of saying
you fell on your huge ass?</font>

1059
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:38,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a matter of fact, falling
was a tactic lulling the Destroyer...</font>

1060
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:56,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My Queen, I'm so sorry for your loss.</font>

1061
01:43:01,842 --> 01:43:03,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is he?</font>

1062
01:43:05,513 --> 01:43:07,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He mourns for his brother.</font>

1063
01:43:08,849 --> 01:43:10,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And...</font>

1064
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:12,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He misses hen</font>

1065
01:43:13,771 --> 01:43:15,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The mortal.</font>

1066
01:43:31,539 --> 01:43:33,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be a wise king.</font>

1067
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:40,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There will never be
a wiser king than you.</font>

1068
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:43,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or a better father.</font>

1069
01:43:54,103 --> 01:43:57,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have much to learn.</font>

1070
01:43:59,275 --> 01:44:00,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that now.</font>

1071
01:44:05,781 --> 01:44:07,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someday, perhaps,</font>

1072
01:44:09,034 --> 01:44:10,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shall make you proud.</font>

1073
01:44:18,586 --> 01:44:20,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've already made me proud.</font>

1074
01:44:35,352 --> 01:44:37,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So Earth is lost to us.</font>

1075
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:39,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1076
01:44:40,691 --> 01:44:42,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is always hope.</font>

1077
01:44:46,697 --> 01:44:48,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you see her?</font>

1078
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:52,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1079
01:44:56,123 --> 01:44:58,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have the particle detectors!</font>

1080
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:00,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darcy, do you have the S.H.I.E.L.D.
satellite codes?</font>

1081
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:02,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Have you seen my taser?</font>

1082
01:45:02,463 --> 01:45:03,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is she?</font>

1083
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:06,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the car. Come on, Jane!</font>

1084
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:08,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She searches for you.</font>

1085
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:19,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Selvig.</font>

1086
01:53:22,796 --> 01:53:24,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're the man behind all this?</font>

1087
01:53:27,134 --> 01:53:29,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's quite a labyrinth.</font>

1088
01:53:29,886 --> 01:53:33,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was thinking
they're taking me down here to kill me.</font>

1089
01:53:40,981 --> 01:53:43,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been hearing
about the New Mexico situation.</font>

1090
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:48,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your work has impressed a lot of people
who are much smarter than I am.</font>

1091
01:53:48,572 --> 01:53:50,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a lot to work with.</font>

1092
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:54,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Foster Theory.
A gateway to another dimension.</font>

1093
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:56,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's unprecedented.</font>

1094
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:00,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't it?</font>

1095
01:54:03,503 --> 01:54:06,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Legend tells us one thing,
history, another.</font>

1096
01:54:07,174 --> 01:54:11,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But every now and then,
we find something that belongs to both.</font>

1097
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:20,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

1098
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:21,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Power, Doctor.</font>

1099
01:54:21,938 --> 01:54:23,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we can figure out how to tap it,</font>

1100
01:54:24,358 --> 01:54:25,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">maybe unlimited power.</font>

1101
01:54:31,615 --> 01:54:33,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I guess that's worth a look.</font>

1102
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:37,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I guess that's worth a look.</font>
