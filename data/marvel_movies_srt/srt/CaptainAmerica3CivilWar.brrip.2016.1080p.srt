<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, they deserve it.</font>

197
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plus, it helps ease my conscience.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right?</font>

202
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:53,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you going up?</font>

203
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:56,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm right where I want to be.</font>

204
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Hey.</font>

205
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.</font>

00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I work for the State Department.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">In Sokovia.</font>

214
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:34,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not that that matters in the least to you.</font>

215
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:37,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you fight for us?</font>

00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just fight for yourself.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?</font>

218
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's dead...</font>

00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there are some...</font>

278
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who would prefer the word "vigilantes."</font>

279
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:47,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What word would you use,
Mr. Secretary?</font>

280
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about "dangerous"?</font>

281
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:52,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would you call
a group of US-based,</font>

282
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">enhanced individuals...</font>

283
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who routinely ignore
sovereign borders...</font>

284
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:01,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and inflict their will
wherever they choose...</font>

285
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:04,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and who, frankly, seem unconcerned</font>

286
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about what they leave behind?</font>

287
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">New York.</font>

288

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lagos.</font>

291
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. That's enough.</font>

292
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:03,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the past 4 years,</font>

293
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you've operated with unlimited power...</font>

294
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:06,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and no supervision.</font>

295
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:08,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's an arrangement
the governments of the world</font>

296
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can no longer tolerate.</font>

297
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I think we have a solution.</font>

298
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Sokovia Accords.</font>

299
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Approved by 117 countries...</font>

300
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:28,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it states that the Avengers</font>

301
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">shall no longer be a private organisation.</font>

302
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Instead...</font>

303
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they'll operate under the supervision</font>

304
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:36,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of a United Nations panel...</font>

305
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:41,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">only when and if that panel
deems it necessary.</font>

306
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Avengers were formed to
make the world a safer place.</font>

307
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:46,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel we've done that.</font>

308
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:51,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me, Captain, do you know
where Thor and Banner are right now?</font>

309
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I misplaced a couple of
30 megaton nukes...</font>

310
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:57,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you can bet there'd be consequences.</font>

311
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:02,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Compromise. Reassurance.
That's how the world works.</font>

312
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Believe me, this is the middle ground.</font>

313
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, there are contingencies.</font>

314
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:12,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 days from now,
the UN meets in Vienna...</font>

315
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:14,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to ratify the Accords.</font>

316
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:17,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Talk it over.</font>

317
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:23,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if we come
to a decision you don't like?</font>

318
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:26,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you retire.</font>

319
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

320
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:55,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this your car out front?</font>

321
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I jumped the kerb.</font>

322
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we could...</font>

323
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">take care of it ourselves.</font>

324
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you wanna call the cops,
that's okay, too...</font>

325
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I guess.
- No.</font>

326
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:10,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No cops.</font>

327
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:11,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

328
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have kept your looks, Colonel.</font>

329
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:53,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Mission report. December 16, 1991."</font>

331
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

332
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Zemo.</font>

333
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:09,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will repeat my question.</font>

334
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:14,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mission report, December 16, 1991.</font>

335
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:16,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you find me?</font>

336
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell...</font>

337
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:22,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Black Widow released
HYDRA files to the public.</font>

338
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:25,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Millions of pages. Much of it encrypted.</font>

339
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not easy to decipher.</font>

340
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, I have experience.</font>

341
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:34,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And patience.</font>

342
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:38,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A man can do anything if he has those.</font>

343
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want?</font>

344
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:43,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mission report.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go... to... hell!</font>

348
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">HYDRA deserves its place
on the ash heap.</font>

349
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So your death would not bother me.</font>

350
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:13,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'd have to use this book...</font>

351
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:17,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and other bloodier methods
to find what I need.</font>

352
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:19,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't look forward to that.</font>

353
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:23,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd only be dying for...</font>

00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:24,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your pride.</font>

a Congressional Medal of Honour...</font>

357
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:57,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is one more than you have.</font>

358
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So let's say we agree to this thing.</font>

359
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:01,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long is it gonna be
before they LoJack us</font>

360
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:02,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like a bunch of common criminals?</font>

361
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">117 countries want to sign this.</font>

362
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:07,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">117, Sam, and you're just like,
"No, that's cool. We got it."</font>

363
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:08,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long are you going
to play both sides?</font>

364
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:09,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have an equation.</font>

365
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, this will clear it up.</font>

366
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the 8 years since Mr. Stark</font>

367
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">announced himself as Iron Man...</font>

00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:19,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the number of known enhanced persons
has grown exponentially.</font>

369
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">During the same period...</font>

370
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the number of potentially
world-ending events</font>

371
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:26,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has risen at a commensurate rate.</font>

372
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:27,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you saying it's our fault?</font>

373
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:30,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm saying there may be a causality.</font>

374
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:35,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our very strength invites challenge.</font>

375
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Challenge incites conflict.</font>

376
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And conflict...</font>

377
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:43,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">breeds catastrophe.</font>

378
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:45,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oversight...</font>

379
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:50,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oversight is not an idea that
can be dismissed out of hand.</font>

380
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:51,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boom.</font>

00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony.</font>

382
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are being uncharacteristically
non-hyperverbal.</font>

383
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's because he's already
made up his mind.</font>

384
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boy, you know me so well.</font>

385
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:03,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, I'm nursing
an electromagnetic headache.</font>

386
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:07,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what's going on, Cap.
It's just pain.</font>

387
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's discomfort.</font>

388
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:12,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's putting coffee grounds
in the disposal?</font>

389
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:15,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I running a bed and breakfast
for a biker gang?</font>

390
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way.</font>

391
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:24,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a great kid.</font>

392
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Computer engineering degree,
3.6 GPA...</font>

393
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:31,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">had a floor-level gig
at Intel planned for the fall.</font>

394
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:33,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But first, he wanted to put
a few miles on his soul...</font>

395
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before he parked it
behind a desk. See the world.</font>

396
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe be of service.</font>

397
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or</font>

398
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:42,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fort Lauderdale,
which is what I would do.</font>

399
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:44,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam,
which sounds fun.</font>

400
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He decided to spend his summer</font>

401
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:48,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">building sustainable housing
for the poor.</font>

402
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess where. Sokovia.</font>

403
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:55,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wanted to make
a difference, I suppose.</font>

404
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:56,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We won't know because we dropped</font>

405
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a building on him
while we were kicking ass.</font>

406
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no decision-making
process here.</font>

407
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:12,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to be put in check!</font>

408
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:15,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever form that takes, I'm game.</font>

409
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:16,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we can't accept limitations,</font>

410
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:17,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if we're boundary-less...</font>

411
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:19,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we're no better than the bad guys.</font>

412
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:22,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, someone dies on your watch,
you don't give up.</font>

413
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:23,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who said we're giving up?</font>

414
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:26,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are if we're not
taking responsibility for our actions.</font>

415
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This document just shifts the blame.</font>

416
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:29,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Steve.</font>

417
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:31,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is dangerously arrogant.</font>

418
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the United Nations
we're talking about.</font>

419
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not the World Security Council,</font>

420
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:37,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's not S.H.I.E.L.D., it's not HYDRA.</font>

421
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:39,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, but it's run by people</font>

422
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:40,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with agendas, and agendas change.</font>

423
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's good. That's why I'm here.</font>

424
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I realised what my weapons
were capable of in the wrong hands...</font>

425
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:47,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shut it down
and stopped manufacturing.</font>

426
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:49,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, you chose to do that.</font>

427
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:52,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we sign this, we surrender
our right to choose.</font>

428
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if this panel sends us somewhere
we don't think we should go?</font>

429
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if there is somewhere
we need to go</font>

430
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they don't let us?</font>

431
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We may not be perfect,</font>

432
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the safest hands are still our own.</font>

433
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:04,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we don't do this now,</font>

434
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:06,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's gonna be done to us later.</font>

435
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the fact. That won't be pretty.</font>

436
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:09,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're saying they'll come for me.</font>

437
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We would protect you.</font>

438
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:13,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe Tony's right.</font>

439
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:16,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we have one hand on the wheel,</font>

440
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we can still steer. If we take it off...</font>

441
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:20,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't you the same woman
who told the government</font>

442
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to kiss her ass a few years ago?</font>

443
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:24,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just reading the terrain.</font>

444
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:28,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have made some
very public mistakes.</font>

445
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:30,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to win their trust back.</font>

446
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:32,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Focus up. I'm sorry.
Did I just mishear you...</font>

447
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- or did you agree with me?
- I want to take it back now.</font>

448
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:35,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you can't retract it.</font>

449
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:37,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. Unprecedented.</font>

450
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:41,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Case closed. I win.</font>

451
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:43,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to go.</font>

452
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:29,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now, I would like
to invite Sharon Carter</font>

453
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:31,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to come up and say a few words.</font>

454
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:48,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Margaret Carter was known to most
as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D...</font>

455
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.</font>

456
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:55,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She had a photograph in her office.</font>

457
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.</font>

458
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a kid, that was pretty cool.</font>

459
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:04,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it was a lot to live up to.</font>

460
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is why I never told
anyone we were related.</font>

461
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I asked her once how she managed</font>

462
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:12,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to master diplomacy and espionage...</font>

463
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:16,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a time when no one wanted to see
a woman succeed at either.</font>

464
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said, compromise where you can.</font>

465
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:23,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But where you can't, don't.</font>

466
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:29,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even if everyone is telling you
that something wrong is something right.</font>

467
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:33,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even if the whole world
is telling you to move...</font>

468
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:36,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it is your duty to plant
yourself like a tree...</font>

469
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">look them in the eye and say
"No, you move."</font>

470
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:55,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I came out of the ice,</font>

471
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:57,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought everyone
I had known was gone.</font>

472
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I found out she was alive.</font>

473
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:03,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just lucky to have her.</font>

474
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:05,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She had you back, too.</font>

475
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who else signed?</font>

476
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:12,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, Rhodey, Vision.</font>

477
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:14,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clint?</font>

478
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:17,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Says he's retired.</font>

479
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:19,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wanda?
- TBD.</font>

480
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:23,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm off to Vienna
for the signing of the Accords.</font>

481
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's plenty of room on the jet.</font>

482
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just because it's the path
of least resistance...</font>

483
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:34,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">doesn't mean it's the wrong path.</font>

484
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:37,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Staying together is more important
than how we stay together.</font>

485
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:40,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are we giving up to do it?</font>

486
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Nat.</font>

487
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:47,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't sign it.</font>

488
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:50,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

489
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:54,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then what are you doing here?</font>

490
00:34:56,888 --> 00:34:59,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't want you to be alone.</font>

491
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:07,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here.</font>

492
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:15,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>At a special
United Nations conference...</i></font>

493

495
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, Ms Romanoff?</font>

496
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:28,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes?
- These need your signature.</font>

497
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:31,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- Thanks.</font>

498
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suppose neither of us
is used to the spotlight.</font>

499
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.</font>

500
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:41,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You seem to be doing all right so far.</font>

501
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Considering your last trip
to Capitol Hill...</font>

502
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:48,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't think you'd be particularly
comfortable in this company.</font>

503
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:49,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm not.</font>

504
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that alone makes me glad
you are here, Ms. Romanoff.</font>

505
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:54,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why? You don't approve of all this?</font>

506
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Accords, yes.
The politics, not really.</font>

507
00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:01,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two people in a room can get
more done than a hundred.</font>

508
00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:04,084

509
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:07,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms Romanoff.</font>

510

for what happened in Nigeria.</font>

512
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:13,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

513
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:15,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for agreeing to all of this.</font>

514
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:19,263

519
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:29,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Such a pleasure.</font>

520
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:30,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

521
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:35,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For a man
who disapproves of diplomacy,</font>

522
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:38,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're getting quite good at it.</font>

530
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:03,349

532
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:10,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will not, however,

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

685
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:56,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you're welcome.</font>

686
00:52:56,842 --> 00:53:00,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's a involuntary response
in their amygdala.</font>

687
00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:02,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They can't help but be afraid of you.</font>

688
00:53:02,556 --> 00:53:03,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you?</font>

689
00:53:03,598 --> 00:53:05,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My amygdala is synthetic, so...</font>

690
00:53:09,104 --> 00:53:12,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to think of myself one way.</font>

691
00:53:13,942 --> 00:53:15,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But after this...</font>

692
00:53:16,278 --> 00:53:18,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am something else.</font>

693
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:22,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm still me, I think, but...</font>

694
00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:26,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's not what everyone else sees.</font>

695
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:32,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know, I don't know what this is?</font>

696
00:53:33,128 --> 00:53:34,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not really.</font>

697
00:53:34,629 --> 00:53:36,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it's not of this world...</font>

698
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:37,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that it powered Loki's staff,</font>

699
00:53:38,091 --> 00:53:40,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">gave you your abilities, but...</font>

700
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:44,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">its true nature is a mystery.</font>

701
00:53:45,265 --> 00:53:47,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yet, it is part of me.</font>

702
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you afraid of it?</font>

703
00:53:49,311 --> 00:53:51,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish to understand it.</font>

704
00:53:51,813 --> 00:53:53,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The more I do, the less it controls me.</font>

705
00:53:54,149 --> 00:53:57,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One day... who knows?</font>

706
00:53:57,235 --> 00:53:58,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I may even control it.</font>

707
00:54:01,197 --> 00:54:05,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what's in this
but it is not paprika.</font>

708
00:54:05,827 --> 00:54:07,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna go to the store.</font>

709
00:54:08,538 --> 00:54:10,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be back in 20 minutes.</font>

710
00:54:10,749 --> 00:54:13,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alternatively, we could order a pizza?</font>

711
00:54:15,003 --> 00:54:17,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vision, are you not letting me leave?</font>

712
00:54:19,549 --> 00:54:21,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is a question of safety.</font>

713
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:23,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can protect myself.</font>

714
00:54:24,846 --> 00:54:26,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not yours.</font>

715
00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:30,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stark would like to
avoid the possibility</font>

716
00:54:30,685 --> 00:54:32,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of another public incident.</font>

717
00:54:32,854 --> 00:54:36,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until the Accords are on
a more secure foundation.</font>

718
00:54:39,486 --> 00:54:41,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what do you want?</font>

719
00:54:42,656 --> 00:54:44,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For people to see you...</font>

720
00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:46,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as I do.</font>

721
00:55:19,693 --> 00:55:20,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you like cats?</font>

722
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sam.
- What?</font>

723
00:55:22,821 --> 00:55:25,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude shows up dressed like a cat,
you don't wanna know more?</font>

724
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:29,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your suit... it's vibranium?</font>

725
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:35,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Black Panther
has been the protector</font>

726
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:37,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of Wakanda for generations.</font>

727
00:55:38,211 --> 00:55:41,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior.</font>

728
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:45,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now, because your friend
murdered my father...</font>

729
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:49,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I also wear the mantle of king.</font>

730
00:55:50,098 --> 00:55:51,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I ask you...</font>

731
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:54,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as both warrior and king...</font>

732
00:55:55,854 --> 00:55:59,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how long do you think you can
keep your friend safe from me?</font>

733
00:56:19,419 --> 00:56:20,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's gonna happen to him?</font>

734
00:56:20,879 --> 00:56:23,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Same thing that ought to happen to you.</font>

735
00:56:23,173 --> 00:56:25,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Psychological evaluation
and extradition.</font>

736
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Everett Ross,
Deputy Task Force Commander.</font>

737
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:28,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about a lawyer?</font>

738
00:56:29,137 --> 00:56:30,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lawyer. That's funny.</font>

739
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:33,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See their weapons are placed in lockup.</font>

740
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:35,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll write you a receipt.</font>

741
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:38,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I better not look out the window
and see anybody flying around in that.</font>

742
00:56:44,694 --> 00:56:46,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be
provided with an office</font>

743
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:47,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">instead of a cell.</font>

744
00:56:47,822 --> 00:56:49,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, do me a favour, stay in it?</font>

745
00:56:50,492 --> 00:56:52,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't intend on going anywhere.</font>

746
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:56,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the record, this is what
making things worse looks like.</font>

747
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:57,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's alive.</font>

748
00:56:57,999 --> 00:56:59,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

749
00:56:59,793 --> 00:57:02,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Romania was not Accords-sanctioned.</font>

750
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:03,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.</font>

751
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:05,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try not to break anything
while we fix this.</font>

752
00:57:06,049 --> 00:57:08,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Consequences? You bet
there'll be consequences.</font>

753
00:57:08,593 --> 00:57:10,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Obviously you can quote me on that,</font>

754
00:57:10,303 --> 00:57:11,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because I just said it. Anything else?</font>

755
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:12,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, sir.</font>

756
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Consequences"?</font>

757
00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:17,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Secretary Ross
wants you both prosecuted.</font>

758
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Had to give him something.</font>

759
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not getting that shield back, am I?</font>

760
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:21,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Technically, it's the
government's property.</font>

761
00:57:21,773 --> 00:57:22,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wings, too.</font>

762
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:24,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's cold.</font>

763
00:57:24,526 --> 00:57:25,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Warmer than jail.</font>

764
00:57:53,513 --> 00:57:55,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you wanna see
something cool?</font>

765
00:57:56,391 --> 00:57:58,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I pulled something from Dad's archives.</font>

766
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:01,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Felt timely.</font>

767
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
with these in 1941.</font>

768
00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:12,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Provided support to the Allies
when they needed it most.</font>

769
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some would say it brought
our country closer to war.</font>

770
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:18,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? If not for these,
you wouldn't be here.</font>

771
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:22,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying to... What do you call it?</font>

772
00:58:23,293 --> 00:58:25,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's an olive branch.</font>

773
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:27,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that what you call it?</font>

774
00:58:29,007 --> 00:58:31,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.</font>

775
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:35,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're kinda...</font>

776
00:58:35,597 --> 00:58:37,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, not kinda...
- Pregnant?</font>

777
00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:39,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Definitely not.</font>

778
00:58:39,392 --> 00:58:41,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're taking a break.</font>

779
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:42,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's nobody's fault.</font>

780
00:58:44,147 --> 00:58:45,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.</font>

781
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:49,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A few years ago, I almost lost her,
so I trashed all my suits.</font>

782
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:52,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, we had to mop up HYDRA...</font>

783
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then Ultron. My fault.</font>

784
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:58,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.</font>

785
00:58:58,411 --> 00:59:00,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because the truth is I don't wanna stop.</font>

786
00:59:02,165 --> 00:59:04,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't wanna lose her.</font>

787
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:06,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.</font>

788
00:59:10,632 --> 00:59:12,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In her defence, I'm a handful.</font>

789
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,</font>

790
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:18,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but he and Mom always made it work.</font>

791
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:19,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm glad Howard got married.</font>

792
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:22,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I only knew him
when he was young and single.</font>

793
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:24,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, really? You two knew each other?</font>

794
00:59:24,812 --> 00:59:26,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He never mentioned that.</font>

795
00:59:26,356 --> 00:59:28,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe only a thousand times.</font>

796
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:30,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I hated you.</font>

797
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:34,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't mean to make things difficult.</font>

798
00:59:34,781 --> 00:59:37,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, because you're
a very polite person.</font>

799
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I see a situation pointed south...</font>

800
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:42,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't ignore it.</font>

801
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:43,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes I wish I could.</font>

802
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:44,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you don't.</font>

803
00:59:48,127 --> 00:59:49,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I don't.</font>

804
00:59:50,338 --> 00:59:51,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes...</font>

805
00:59:51,506 --> 00:59:54,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes I wanna
punch you in your perfect teeth.</font>

806
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:56,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I don't wanna see you gone.</font>

807
00:59:57,345 --> 00:59:58,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need you, Cap.</font>

808
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:03,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So far, nothing's happened
that can't be undone, if you sign.</font>

809
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:05,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can make the last 24 hours legit.</font>

810
01:00:05,478 --> 01:00:07,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Barnes gets transferred to
an American psych-centre...</font>

811
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:09,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">instead of a Wakandan prison.</font>

812
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:23,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not saying it's impossible...</font>

813
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:25,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but there would have to be safeguards.</font>

814
01:00:25,373 --> 01:00:26,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

815
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:28,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once we put out the PR fire,</font>

816
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:30,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">those documents can be amended.</font>

817
01:00:30,545 --> 01:00:32,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated...</font>

818
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:34,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanda? What about Wanda?</font>

819
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's fine. She's confined

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that how you see this?</font>

828

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:44,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would the Task Force
release this photo to begin with?</font>

852
01:02:44,387 --> 01:02:46,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the word out,
involve as many eyes as we can?</font>

853
01:02:46,848 --> 01:02:49,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. It's a good way
to flush a guy out of hiding.</font>

854
01:02:49,892 --> 01:02:51,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Set off a bomb, get your picture taken.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're saying someone
framed him to find him?</font>

857
01:02:56,274 --> 01:02:57,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steve, we looked
for the guy for 2 years</font>

859
01:02:58,526 --> 01:03:00,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We didn't bomb the UN.
That turns a lot of heads.</font>

860
01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:02,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah,
but that doesn't guarantee</font>

01:03:02,029 --> 01:03:03,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that whoever framed him would get him.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">It guarantees that we would.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

864

875
01:04:15,978 --> 01:04:17,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't we discuss your home?</font>

876
01:04:17,772 --> 01:04:20,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not Romania.
Certainly not Brooklyn, no.</font>

01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:25,359

01:14:53,991 --> 01:14:56,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- If we call Tony...
- No, he won't believe us.</font>

958
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:57,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even if he did...</font>

959
01:14:57,286 --> 01:14:59,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who knows if the Accords
would let him help.</font>

960
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:01,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're on our own.</font>

961
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:03,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe not.</font>

962
01:15:05,878 --> 01:15:07,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know a guy.</font>

963
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:11,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't suppose you have
any idea where they are?</font>

964
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:12,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will.</font>

965
01:15:12,593 --> 01:15:14,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">GSG 9's got the borders covered.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Recon's flying 24/7.</font>

01:15:16,221 --> 01:15:17,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.</font>

968
01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:19,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't get it, Stark.
It's not yours to handle.</font>

969
01:15:19,892 --> 01:15:22,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's clear you can't be objective.</font>

970
01:15:22,394 --> 01:15:23,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm putting Special Ops on this.</font>

971
01:15:23,979 --> 01:15:25,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happens
when the shooting starts?</font>

972
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:26,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, do you kill Steve Rogers?</font>

973
01:15:26,607 --> 01:15:27,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we're provoked.</font>

974
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:31,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Barnes would've been eliminated
in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers.</font>

975
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:35,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are dead people
who would be alive now.</font>

976
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:38,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feel free to check my math.</font>

977
01:15:38,493 --> 01:15:39,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All due respect,
you're not gonna solve this</font>

978
01:15:39,912 --> 01:15:41,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with boys and bullets, Ross.</font>

979
01:15:41,246 --> 01:15:42,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta let us bring them in.</font>

980
01:15:42,706 --> 01:15:44,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How would that end
any differently than last time?</font>

981
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:45,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because this time,</font>

982
01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:47,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't be wearing loafers
and a silk shirt.</font>

983
01:15:48,795 --> 01:15:50,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">72 hours, guaranteed.</font>

984
01:15:50,839 --> 01:15:52,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">36 hours.</font>

985
01:15:54,218 --> 01:15:55,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Barnes.</font>

986
01:15:57,012 --> 01:15:58,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rogers.</font>

987

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wilson.</font>

988
01:16:00,182 --> 01:16:01,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, sir.</font>

989
01:16:05,604 --> 01:16:07,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My left arm is numb. Is that normal?</font>

990
01:16:10,943 --> 01:16:12,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all right?</font>

991
01:16:12,194 --> 01:16:13,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always.</font>

992
01:16:17,366 --> 01:16:19,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">36 hours. Jeez.</font>

993
01:16:19,785 --> 01:16:21,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're seriously understaffed.</font>

994
01:16:21,995 --> 01:16:23,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font>

995
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:26,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'd be great if we had
a Hulk right about now. Any shot?</font>

996
01:16:28,252 --> 01:16:30,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really think he'd be on our side?</font>

997
01:16:31,046 --> 01:16:32,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

998
01:16:32,256 --> 01:16:33,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have an idea.</font>

999
01:16:33,715 --> 01:16:36,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, too. Where's yours?</font>

1000
01:16:36,218 --> 01:16:38,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Downstairs.</font>

1001
01:16:38,178 --> 01:16:39,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's yours?</font>

1002
01:17:01,326 --> 01:17:02,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, May.</font>

1003
01:17:02,869 --> 01:17:04,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm. Hey.</font>

1004
01:17:06,164 --> 01:17:07,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How was school today?</font>

1005
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:09,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was okay.</font>

1006
01:17:09,501 --> 01:17:11,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This crazy car parked outside.</font>

1007
01:17:15,299 --> 01:17:17,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, Mr. Parker.
- Um...</font>

1008
01:17:19,261 --> 01:17:21,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing...</font>

1009
01:17:21,471 --> 01:17:23,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Uh, I'm Peter.</font>

1010
01:17:23,432 --> 01:17:24,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony.</font>

1011
01:17:25,183 --> 01:17:26,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing here?</font>

1012
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:28,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's about time we met.</font>

1013
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:29,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've been getting my emails, right?</font>

1014
01:17:30,188 --> 01:17:31,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?</font>

1015
01:17:31,982 --> 01:17:32,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Regarding the...</font>

1016
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:34,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't even tell me about the grant.</font>

1017
01:17:34,234 --> 01:17:35,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- About the grant.
- The September Foundation.</font>

1018
01:17:35,902 --> 01:17:36,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right.
- Yeah.</font>

1019
01:17:36,945 --> 01:17:37,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember when you applied?</font>

1020
01:17:38,071 --> 01:17:39,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1021
01:17:39,281 --> 01:17:41,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I approved, so now we're in business.</font>

1022
01:17:42,409 --> 01:17:44,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?</font>

1023
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:45,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You keeping secrets from me now?</font>

1024
01:17:45,787 --> 01:17:49,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just know how much you love surprises
so I thought I would let you know...</font>

1025
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:51,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, what did I apply for?</font>

1026
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:53,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I'm here to hash out.</font>

1027
01:17:53,086 --> 01:17:54,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Hash it out, okay.</font>

1028
01:17:54,546 --> 01:17:57,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's so hard for me to believe
that she's someone's aunt.</font>

1029
01:17:57,341 --> 01:17:59,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, we come in
all shapes and sizes, you know?</font>

1030
01:18:00,052 --> 01:18:02,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This walnut date loaf is exceptional.</font>

1031
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:03,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let me just stop you there.
- Yeah.</font>

1032
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:07,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this grant got money
involved or whatever? No?</font>

1033
01:18:07,893 --> 01:18:09,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's pretty well funded.</font>

1034
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:10,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah? Wow.</font>

1035
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:12,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look who you're talking to.</font>

1036
01:18:12,272 --> 01:18:14,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can I have five minutes with him?
- Sure.</font>

1037
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:23,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As walnut date loaves go,
that wasn't bad.</font>

1038
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:27,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, what have we here?
Retro tech, huh?</font>

1039
01:18:27,829 --> 01:18:29,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thrift store? Salvation Army?</font>

1040
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:31,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh, the garbage, actually.
- You're a dumpster diver?</font>

1041
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:32,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I was...</font>

1042
01:18:33,043 --> 01:18:34,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, look, um,</font>

1043
01:18:34,586 --> 01:18:36,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I definitely did not apply
for your grant...</font>

1044
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:37,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ah-ah! Me first.
- Okay.</font>

1045
01:18:38,006 --> 01:18:40,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quick question of the rhetorical variety.</font>

1046
01:18:41,843 --> 01:18:43,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's you, right?</font>

1047
01:18:44,179 --> 01:18:45,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, no.</font>

1048
01:18:45,347 --> 01:18:46,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do you mean?
- Yeah.</font>

1049
01:18:47,808 --> 01:18:49,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at you go.</font>

1050
01:18:49,601 --> 01:18:52,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.</font>

1051
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:55,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not easy. You got mad skills.</font>

1052
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:57,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all on YouTube, though, right?</font>

1053
01:18:57,818 --> 01:18:59,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's where you found that?</font>

1054
01:18:59,486 --> 01:19:00,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you know that's all fake.</font>

1055
01:19:00,612 --> 01:19:01,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all done on the computer.</font>

1056
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:02,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm-hmm.</font>

1057
01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:05,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like that video. What is it?</font>

1058
01:19:05,242 --> 01:19:07,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?</font>

1059
01:19:07,202 --> 01:19:08,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly.</font>

1060
01:19:08,537 --> 01:19:09,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, what have we here?</font>

1061
01:19:11,206 --> 01:19:12,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

1062
01:19:18,964 --> 01:19:20,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the Spider-ling.</font>

1063
01:19:20,966 --> 01:19:22,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crime-fighting spider.
You're Spider-Boy?</font>

1064
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spider-Man.</font>

1065
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:29,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not in that onesie, you're not.</font>

1066
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:31,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a onesie.</font>

1067
01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:34,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't believe this.
I was actually having</font>

1068
01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:36,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a really good day today, Mr. Stark.</font>

1069
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:39,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there...</font>

1070
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:43,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Algebra test, nailed it.</font>

1071
01:19:43,905 --> 01:19:45,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who else knows? Anybody?</font>

1072
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody.</font>

1073
01:19:48,452 --> 01:19:50,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not even your unusually attractive aunt?</font>

1074
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:51,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No.</font>

1075
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! If she knew, she would freak out.</font>

1076
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when she freaks out, I freak out.</font>

1077
01:19:56,835 --> 01:19:58,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I think
is really cool? This webbing.</font>

1078
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:02,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That tensile strength is off the charts.</font>

1079
01:20:02,591 --> 01:20:03,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who manufactured that?</font>

1080
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:05,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did.</font>

1081
01:20:06,553 --> 01:20:08,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Climbing walls, how you doing that?</font>

1082
01:20:08,305 --> 01:20:09,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Adhesive gloves?</font>

1083
01:20:09,723 --> 01:20:11,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a long story. I was...</font>

1084
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:13,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lordy! Can you even see in these?</font>

1085
01:20:14,019 --> 01:20:15,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I can.</font>

1086
01:20:15,187 --> 01:20:16,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm blind!</font>

1087
01:20:17,314 --> 01:20:18,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see in those.</font>

1088
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:19,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay?</font>

1089
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:22,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...</font>

1090
01:20:22,486 --> 01:20:24,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's like my senses
have been dialled to 11.</font>

1091
01:20:25,322 --> 01:20:29,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's way too much input,
so they just kinda help me focus.</font>

1092
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:32,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're in dire need of an upgrade.</font>

1093
01:20:32,287 --> 01:20:34,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.</font>

1094
01:20:34,748 --> 01:20:35,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I'm here.</font>

1095
01:20:38,793 --> 01:20:39,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why you doing this?</font>

1096
01:20:41,338 --> 01:20:42,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta know, what's your MO?</font>

1097
01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:44,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What gets you outta that
twin bed in the morning?</font>

1098
01:20:45,133 --> 01:20:46,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because...</font>

1099
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:52,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I've been me my whole life,</font>

1100
01:20:52,432 --> 01:20:54,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I've had these powers
for 6 months.</font>

1101
01:20:54,559 --> 01:20:55,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm-hmm.</font>

1102
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:58,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I read books, I build computers.</font>

1103
01:20:59,397 --> 01:21:02,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I would love to play football,</font>

1104
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:03,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.</font>

1105
01:21:03,944 --> 01:21:05,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, because you're different.</font>

1106
01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:08,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.</font>

1107
01:21:12,244 --> 01:21:16,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...</font>

1108
01:21:18,959 --> 01:21:21,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then the bad things happen...</font>

1109
01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:23,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they happen because of you.</font>

1110
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:30,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you wanna look out for the little guy,
you wanna do your part?</font>

1111
01:21:30,887 --> 01:21:33,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make the world
a better place, all that, right?</font>

1112
01:21:33,348 --> 01:21:35,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.</font>

1113
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:38,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what it is.</font>

1114
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:47,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.</font>

1115
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:58,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a passport?</font>

1116
01:21:58,123 --> 01:21:59,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I don't even have a driver's licence.</font>

1117
01:21:59,666 --> 01:22:01,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You ever been to Germany?
- No.</font>

1118
01:22:01,209 --> 01:22:02,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you'll love it.</font>

1119
01:22:02,419 --> 01:22:04,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't go to Germany.
- Why?</font>

1120
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:08,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got homework.</font>

1121
01:22:08,675 --> 01:22:10,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.</font>

1122
01:22:10,844 --> 01:22:12,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.</font>

1123
01:22:12,929 --> 01:22:14,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Might be a little dangerous.</font>

1124
01:22:14,097 --> 01:22:16,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.</font>

1125
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't tell Aunt May.</font>

1126
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:22,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Spider-Man.</font>

1127
01:22:26,192 --> 01:22:27,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me out of this.</font>

1128
01:22:27,569 --> 01:22:28,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. I'll get the...</font>

1129
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:42,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

1130
01:22:42,959 --> 01:22:44,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay here, please.</font>

1131
01:22:51,009 --> 01:22:52,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess I shoulda knocked.</font>

1132
01:22:52,844 --> 01:22:56,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God! What are you doing here?</font>

1133
01:22:56,264 --> 01:22:58,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Disappointing my kids.</font>

1134
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:03,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm supposed to go waterskiing.</font>

1135
01:23:04,356 --> 01:23:06,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cap needs our help. Come on.</font>

1136
01:23:06,483 --> 01:23:07,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clint!</font>

1137
01:23:09,402 --> 01:23:10,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should not be here.</font>

1138
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:14,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

1139
01:23:14,783 --> 01:23:17,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I retire for, what, like 5 minutes,
and it all goes to shit.</font>

1140
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:20,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please consider
the consequences of your actions.</font>

1141
01:23:20,497 --> 01:23:21,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, they're considered.</font>

1142
01:23:22,874 --> 01:23:24,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, we gotta go.</font>

1143
01:23:28,755 --> 01:23:30,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's this way.</font>

1144
01:23:30,507 --> 01:23:32,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've caused enough problems.</font>

1145
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:38,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta help me, Wanda.</font>

1146
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.</font>

1147
01:23:40,517 --> 01:23:42,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.</font>

1148
01:23:43,561 --> 01:23:44,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

1149
01:23:51,152 --> 01:23:52,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew I should've stretched.</font>

1150
01:24:06,501 --> 01:24:09,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clint, you can't overpower me.</font>

1151
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know I can't.</font>

1152
01:24:11,589 --> 01:24:13,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But she can.</font>

1153
01:24:14,718 --> 01:24:17,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vision, that's enough. Let him go.</font>

1154
01:24:18,722 --> 01:24:19,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm leaving.</font>

1155
01:24:19,848 --> 01:24:20,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't let you.</font>

1156
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1157
01:24:30,859 --> 01:24:32,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you do this...</font>

1158
01:24:33,153 --> 01:24:36,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they will never stop being afraid of you.</font>

1159
01:24:37,615 --> 01:24:40,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't control their fear, only my own.</font>

1160
01:24:53,173 --> 01:24:54,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

1161
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:58,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. We got one more stop.</font>

1162
01:24:59,637 --> 01:25:01,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a matter of time.</font>

1163
01:25:01,431 --> 01:25:04,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our satellites are running
facial, biometric,</font>

1164
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:05,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and behavioural pattern scans.</font>

1165
01:25:10,064 --> 01:25:12,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move or you will be moved.</font>

1166
01:25:13,902 --> 01:25:16,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As entertaining as that would be...</font>

1167
01:25:16,738 --> 01:25:18,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really think you can find him?</font>

1168
01:25:19,407 --> 01:25:21,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My resources are considerable.</font>

1169
01:25:21,242 --> 01:25:23,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes...</font>

1170
01:25:23,703 --> 01:25:26,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you could probably do that
in about half the time.</font>

1171
01:25:27,415 --> 01:25:29,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know where they are.</font>

1172
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:31,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know someone who does.</font>

1173
01:25:34,088 --> 01:25:36,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not sure you understand
the concept of a getaway car.</font>

1174
01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:37,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's low profile.</font>

1175
01:25:38,343 --> 01:25:41,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.</font>

1176
01:25:42,931 --> 01:25:44,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you move your seat up?</font>

1177
01:25:44,599 --> 01:25:45,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1178
01:25:45,975 --> 01:25:47,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I owe you again.</font>

1179
01:25:47,644 --> 01:25:49,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keeping a list.</font>

1180
01:25:52,357 --> 01:25:54,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, he kinda tried to kill me.</font>

1181
01:25:55,026 --> 01:25:57,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too.</font>

1182
01:26:01,074 --> 01:26:03,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're going to come looking for you.</font>

1183
01:26:03,368 --> 01:26:04,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

1184
01:26:07,163 --> 01:26:08,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Sharon.</font>

1185
01:26:24,097 --> 01:26:25,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was...</font>

1186
01:26:25,265 --> 01:26:26,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Late.</font>

1187
01:26:26,266 --> 01:26:27,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn right.</font>

1188
01:26:31,771 --> 01:26:32,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should go.</font>

1189
01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:33,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1190
01:26:58,506 --> 01:26:59,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cap.</font>

1191
01:26:59,841 --> 01:27:02,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I wouldn't have called
if I had any other choice.</font>

1192
01:27:02,135 --> 01:27:03,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, man, you're doing me a favour.</font>

1193
01:27:03,678 --> 01:27:06,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides, I owe a debt.</font>

1194
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:07,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for having my back.</font>

1195
01:27:07,891 --> 01:27:09,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was time to get off my ass.</font>

1196
01:27:09,976 --> 01:27:11,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about our other recruit?</font>

1197
01:27:11,769 --> 01:27:13,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's rarin' to go.</font>

1198
01:27:14,147 --> 01:27:15,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Had to put a little coffee in him...</font>

1199
01:27:16,691 --> 01:27:17,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but he should be good.</font>

1200
01:27:21,195 --> 01:27:22,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What time zone is this?</font>

1201
01:27:22,864 --> 01:27:24,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on.</font>

1202
01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:29,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Captain America!
- Mr Lang.</font>

1203
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:31,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an honour.</font>

1204
01:27:32,373 --> 01:27:34,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm shaking your hand too long.</font>

1205
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:35,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow! This is awesome!</font>

1206
01:27:35,710 --> 01:27:38,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain America.
I know you, too. You're great!</font>

1207
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez.</font>

1208
01:27:43,217 --> 01:27:45,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, look, I wanna say,</font>

1209
01:27:45,094 --> 01:27:47,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you know
a lot of super people, so...</font>

1210
01:27:48,139 --> 01:27:49,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">thinks for thanking of me.</font>

1211
01:27:50,224 --> 01:27:51,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, man!
- What's up, Tic Tac?</font>

1212
01:27:52,185 --> 01:27:53,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, good to see you.</font>

1213
01:27:53,269 --> 01:27:54,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, what happened last time when I...</font>

1214
01:27:54,938 --> 01:27:58,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a great audition,
but it'll never happen again.</font>

1215
01:27:58,358 --> 01:28:00,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They tell you what we're up against?</font>

1216
01:28:00,818 --> 01:28:03,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something about
some psycho-assassins?</font>

1217
01:28:04,364 --> 01:28:06,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're outside the law on this one.</font>

1218
01:28:06,366 --> 01:28:08,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So if you come with us,
you're a wanted man.</font>

1219
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:10,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, what else is new?</font>

1220
01:28:10,536 --> 01:28:11,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should get moving.</font>

1221
01:28:11,579 --> 01:28:13,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got a chopper lined up.</font>

1222
01:28:17,919 --> 01:28:19,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're evacuating the airport.</font>

1223
01:28:19,879 --> 01:28:20,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stark.</font>

1224
01:28:21,047 --> 01:28:22,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stark?</font>

1225
01:28:23,508 --> 01:28:25,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suit up.</font>

1226

he's behind all of this.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway...</font>

1233
01:29:01,587 --> 01:29:03,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in.</font>

1234
01:29:03,798 --> 01:29:06,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was 24 hours ago.
Can you help a brother out?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your old war buddy killed
innocent people yesterday.</font>

super soldiers just like him.</font>

1239
01:29:16,185 --> 01:29:18,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't let the doctor
find them first, Tony. I can't.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you really wanna
punch your way out of this one?</font>

1243
01:29:29,657 --> 01:29:31,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I've run out of patience.</font>

1244

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Underoos!</font>

1245

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nice job, kid.
- Thanks.</font>

1246

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could have stuck the landing
a little better, it's just...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">New suit. It's nothing, Mr. Stark.</font>

1248

to start a conversation.</font>

1275
01:30:45,191 --> 01:30:46,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, there's two
on the parking deck.</font>

1276

1281
01:30:55,868 --> 01:30:56,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What we discussed.</font>

1282

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep your distance, web them up.</font>

1283
01:30:57,870 --> 01:30:59,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, copy that.</font>

1287
01:31:11,759 --> 01:31:13,179

1288
01:31:25,398 --> 01:31:26,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is that?</font>

01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:28,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone's got a gimmick now.</font>

1294
01:31:58,055 --> 01:31:59,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it ain't gonna tickle either.</font>

1295
01:32:04,604 --> 01:32:06,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wanda, I think you hurt
Vision's feelings.</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Okay, first, that's an exaggeration.</i></font>

1298

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I played 18, shot 18.</font>

1303
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:21,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just can't seem to miss.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I detected that, too.</font>

1308
01:32:48,856 --> 01:32:49,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God!</font>

1309
01:32:51,192 --> 01:32:52,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, buddy, I think you lost this!</font>

1310
01:32:58,366 --> 01:32:59,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahh!</font>

1311
01:33:04,914 --> 01:33:06,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those wings carbon fibre?</font>

1312
01:33:06,415 --> 01:33:07,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this stuff coming out of you?</font>

1313
01:33:07,959 --> 01:33:09,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would explain
the rigidity-flexibility ratio,</font>

1314
01:33:09,543 --> 01:33:11,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.</font>

1315
01:33:11,128 --> 01:33:12,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know if you've
been in a fight before...</font>

1316
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but there's usually not this much talking.</font>

1317
01:33:14,632 --> 01:33:15,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, sorry. My bad.</font>

1318
01:33:20,763 --> 01:33:22,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, look, I'd love to keep this up,</font>

1319
01:33:22,473 --> 01:33:24,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I've only got one job here today...</font>

1320
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:27,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I gotta impress Mr. Stark,
so, I'm really sorry.</font>

1321
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:32,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You couldn't have done that earlier?</font>

1322
01:33:33,401 --> 01:33:34,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate you.</font>

1331
01:34:05,349 --> 01:34:06,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this part of the plan?</font>

1332
01:34:06,851 --> 01:34:08,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Well, my plan was go easy on them.</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

1336

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Rogers...</font>

1341
01:34:55,441 --> 01:34:56,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We fight.</font>

1346
01:35:41,737 --> 01:35:43,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Depends on how hard you hit me.</font>

1347
01:35:52,081 --> 01:35:54,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were pulling your punches.</font>

that you don't understand.</font>

1352
01:36:23,988 --> 01:36:25,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stark said you'd say that. Wow.</font>

1353
01:36:35,082 --> 01:36:37,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He also said to go for your legs.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was her name, again?</font>

1594
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:31,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dolores. You called her Dot.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1606
01:57:59,073 --> 01:58:00,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.</font>
