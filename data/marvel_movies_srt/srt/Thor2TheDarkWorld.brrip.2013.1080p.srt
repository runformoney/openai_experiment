1
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:38,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Long before the birth of light,
there was darkness.</font>

2
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And from that darkness
came the Dark Elves.</font>

3
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:48,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Millennia ago,
the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith</font>

4
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sought to transform our universe
back into one of eternal night.</font>

5
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:00,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Such evil was possible
through the power of the Aether,</font>

6
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an ancient force of infinite destruction.</font>

7
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Malekith.</font>

8
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Asgard's forces are upon us.</font>

9
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The noble armies of Asgard,
led by my father, King Bor,</font>

10
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">waged a mighty war
against these creatures.</font>

11
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Send in the Kursed!</font>

12
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:59,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As the Nine Worlds
converged above him,</font>

13
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Malekith could at last
unleash the Aether.</font>

14
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahh!</font>

15
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But Asgard ripped
the weapon from his grasp.</font>

16
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without it, the Dark Elves fell.</font>

17
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With the battle all but lost,</font>

18
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Malekith sacrificed his own people</font>

19
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a desperate attempt
to lay waste to Asgard's army.</font>

20
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their deaths will mean our survival.</font>

21
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This war is far from over.</font>

22
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Malekith was vanquished,
and the Aether was no more.</font>

23
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or so we were led to believe.</font>

24
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:22,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sire, the Aether. Shall we destroy it?</font>

25
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If only we could.</font>

26
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But its power is too great.</font>

27
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bury it deep.</font>

28
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somewhere no one will ever find it.</font>

29
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loki.</font>

30
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Mother.</font>

31
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have I made you proud?</font>

32
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, don't make this worse.</font>

33
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Define "worse."</font>

34
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enough!</font>

35
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will speak to the prisoner alone.</font>

36
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really don't see
what all the fuss is about.</font>

37
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you not truly feel
the gravity of your crimes?</font>

38
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:51,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wherever you go, there is war, ruin,</font>

39
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and death.</font>

40
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I went down to Midgard to rule the
people of Earth as a benevolent god.</font>

41
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like you.</font>

42
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are not gods.
We are born, we live, we die.</font>

43
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just as humans do.</font>

44
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give or take 5,000 years.</font>

45
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:13,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All this because Loki desires a throne.</font>

46
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is my birthright.</font>

47
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your birthright was to die</font>

48
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a child.</font>

49
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cast out onto a frozen rock.</font>

50
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I had not taken you in,</font>

51
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you would not be here now to hate me.</font>

52
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I am for the axe,
then for mercy's sake,</font>

53
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just swing it.</font>

54
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not that I don't love our little talks,</font>

55
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's just...</font>

56
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't love them.</font>

57
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Frigga is the only reason
you're still alive,</font>

58
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you will never see her again.</font>

59
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:52,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will spend the rest of your days
in the dungeons.</font>

60
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what of Thor?</font>

61
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll make that witless oaf king
while I rot in chains.</font>

62
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:05,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor must strive to undo
the damage you have done.</font>

63
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He will bring order to the Nine Realms</font>

64
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then, yes...</font>

65
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He will be king.</font>

66
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

67
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got this completely under control!</font>

68
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that why everything is on fire?</font>

69
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

70
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome.</font>

71
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ha!</font>

72
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All yours.</font>

73
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

74
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I accept your surrender.</font>

75
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone else?</font>

76
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps next time
we should start with the big one.</font>

77
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep moving. Come on!</font>

78
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep moving. Go ahead of me.
Don't you turn around!</font>

79
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do we go next?</font>

80
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:10,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hogun, the peace
is nearly won across the Nine Realms.</font>

81
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should stay here. Be with
your people, where your heart is.</font>

82
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Asgard can wait.</font>

83
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have my thanks.</font>

84
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you have mine.</font>

85
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heimdall, when you're ready.</font>

86
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is Vanaheim secure?</font>

87
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As are Nornheim and Ria.</font>

88
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Though our work would have gone
more quickly with you at the fore.</font>

89
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must think I'm a piece of bread
that needs to be buttered so heavily.</font>

90
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was not my intent.</font>

91
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the first time
since Bifrost was destroyed,</font>

92
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Nine Realms are at peace.</font>

93
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're well reminded of our strength</font>

94
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:37,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you have earned their respect
and my gratitude.</font>

95
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

96
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing out of order</font>

97
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">except your confused
and distracted heart.</font>

98
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't about Jane Foster, Father.</font>

99
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Human lives are fleeting,
they're nothing.</font>

100
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd be better served
by what lies in front of you.</font>

101
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm telling you this, not as the Allfather,</font>

102
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but as your father.</font>

103
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are ready.</font>

104
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The time has come
for you to take the throne.</font>

105
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Embrace and celebrate
what you've won.</font>

106
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Join your warriors.</font>

107
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eat and drink, revel in their celebration.</font>

108
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:10,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least pretend to enjoy yourself.</font>

109
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Another!</font>

110
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was a time
when you would celebrate for weeks.</font>

111
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I remember you celebrated
the Battle of Harokin</font>

112
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so much that you nearly
started the second.</font>

113
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, the first was so much fun.</font>

114
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take a drink with me.</font>

115
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surely, the Allfather could have
no further task for you tonight.</font>

116
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, this is one I set myself.</font>

117
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It does not go unnoticed
that you disappear each night.</font>

118
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are nine realms.</font>

119
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The future king of Asgard
must focus on more than one.</font>

120
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thank you for your sword</font>

121
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.</font>

122
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

123
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what's the story with you?</font>

124
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why does there have to be a story?
There's no story.</font>

125
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You spent the first
ten minutes of our date</font>

126
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">hiding behind a menu
that has three choices on it.</font>

127
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's either chicken,
vegetarian, or fish, Jane.</font>

128
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think there's a story</font>

129
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm thinking
the story involves a guy.</font>

130
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's complicated.</font>

131
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he still around?</font>

132
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he...</font>

133
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Went away.</font>

134
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been there.</font>

135
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The going away. It's hard, isn't it?</font>

136
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was seeing a woman</font>

137
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she took a job in New York.</font>

138
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eventually, the distance killed it.</font>

139
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the fact
that she kept sleeping with other dudes.</font>

140
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No!
- Oh, so many.</font>

141
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. Could we get some wine, please?</font>

142
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, I'd love some.</font>

143
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Richard, this is Darcy.</font>

144
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing here?</font>

145
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:14,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Hello.</font>

146
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I show up to work
at the lab/your mom's house,</font>

147
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:22,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">fully expecting you
to be moping around in your pajamas,</font>

148
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">eating ice cream and obsessing about...</font>

149
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:25,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know who.</font>

150
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah.</font>

151
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're not.
You're wearing lady clothes.</font>

152
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You even showered, didn't you?
You smell good.</font>

153
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there a point to all this?</font>

154
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because there really needs
to be a point to all this.</font>

155
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:35,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

156
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know all that scientific equipment
you don't look at anymore?</font>

157
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might want
to start looking at it again.</font>

158
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the reason
we came all the way out here.</font>

159
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's malfunctioning.</font>

160
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I said.</font>

161
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I did.</font>

162
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you would do something
a little more scientific.</font>

163
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Yeah, it's...</font>

164
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't look like nothing.</font>

165
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It kind of looks like the readings
that Erik was rambling about.</font>

166
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our friend Erik</font>

167
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">kind of went banana balls.</font>

168
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not interested.</font>

169
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm not interested.
- I'm interested.</font>

170
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time for you to go now.</font>

171
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:05,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

172
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Short but sweet.</font>

173
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She needs help.</font>

174
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'm going to have the sea bass.</font>

175
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sea bass, yeah. Sea bass is good.</font>

176
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:24,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass,
sea bass, sea bass, sea bass.</font>

177
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sea bass...</font>

178
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:29,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sea bass.</font>

179
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane?</font>

180
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you should stop
saying "sea bass"</font>

181
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and go after your friend.</font>

182
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was so fun.</font>

183
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll just stay here
and say "sea bass" alone.</font>

184
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:47,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I hate you.</font>

185
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? I said he was cute.</font>

186
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just shut up and drive.</font>

187
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:02,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to take the next left.</font>

188
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who's he?
- He's my intern.</font>

189
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You have an intern?
- Oh, yeah.</font>

190
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Dr. Foster.</font>

191
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's such a great honor
to be working with you.</font>

192
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. I have to call Erik.</font>

193
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, take a right.</font>

194
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And a left.</font>

195
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have totally mastered
driving in London.</font>

196
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Erik. It's me again. Where are you?</font>

197
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I came here because you said you were
onto something, and then you vanish.</font>

198
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here at Stonehenge</font>

199
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for what has been an
interesting unfolding of events today.</font>

200
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The police were called to the scene</font>

201
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">shortly after 11 A.M. this morning</font>

202
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after a seemingly harmless rambler
approached the area</font>

203
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then, decided to strip naked
and effectively</font>

204
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">terrorize tourists there
with scientific equipment</font>

205
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whilst shouting
that he was trying to save them.</font>

206
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The man, later identified
as noted astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig</font>

207
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has been called in
for questioning by police.</font>

208
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, this is exciting.</font>

209
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look! The intern is excited.</font>

210
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Ian."</font>

211
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want the phase meter?</font>

212
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Bring the phase meter.</font>

213
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The toaster-looking thing.</font>

214
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.</font>

215
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do I change the ringtone
on this thing?</font>

216
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An astrophysicist with three degrees</font>

217
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">should be able
to change her own ringtone.</font>

218
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you calling me?</font>

219
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't want to shout.
Intern says it's this way.</font>

220
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- "Ian." My name is Ian.
- Shh.</font>

221
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:51,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not getting stabbed
in the name of science.</font>

222
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, we're Americans.</font>

223
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that supposed to make them like us?</font>

224
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll make it go away.
Shh.</font>

225
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, they're kids.</font>

226
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you the police?</font>

227
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we're scientists. Well, I am.</font>

228
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:06,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

229
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just found it.</font>

230
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you show us?</font>

231
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That doesn't seem right.</font>

232
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where'd it go?</font>

233
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's...</font>

234
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's incredible!</font>

235
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened?</font>

236
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes they come back.</font>

237
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes they don't.</font>

238
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to throw something!</font>

239
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:38,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane, give me your shoe.</font>

240
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't seen readings like this since...</font>

241
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since...</font>

242
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">New Mexico?</font>

243
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't touch anything!</font>

244
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me your shoe.</font>

245
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

246
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Were those the car keys?</font>

247
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa. Ah!</font>

248
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

249
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darcy!</font>

250
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

251
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Aether awakens us.</font>

252
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:06,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Convergence returns.</font>

253
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're late.</font>

254
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:27,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Merriment can sometimes
be a heavier burden than battle.</font>

255
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you're doing
one of them incorrectly.</font>

256
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps.</font>

257
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How fare the stars?</font>

258
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still shining.</font>

259
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From here, I can see
nine realms and 10 trillion souls.</font>

260
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you recall
what I taught you of the Convergence?</font>

261
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

262
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The alignment of the worlds.</font>

263
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It approaches, doesn't it?</font>

264
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:55,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The universe hasn't seen this marvel
since before my watch began.</font>

265
00:23:56,894 --> 00:24:00,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Few can sense it. Even fewer can see it.</font>

266
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:04,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But while its effects can be dangerous,</font>

267
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it is truly beautiful.</font>

268
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see nothing.</font>

269
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or, perhaps,
that is not the beauty you seek.</font>

270
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is she?</font>

271
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:23,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's quite clever,
your mortal.</font>

272
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She doesn't know it yet,</font>

273
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but she studies
the Convergence as well.</font>

274
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even...</font>

275
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:31,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

276
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't see her.</font>

277
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane!</font>

278
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the hell were you?</font>

279
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me you didn't call the police.</font>

280
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was I supposed to do?</font>

281
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not call the police.
- I was freaking out.</font>

282
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You call the cops, they call the Feds.</font>

283
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next thing you know,
we have S.H.I.E.L.D. crawling all over</font>

284
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- "Area 51-ing" the place.
- Jane.</font>

285
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had a stable gravitation anomaly.</font>

286
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had unimpeded access.</font>

287
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our only competition was 10 years old!</font>

288
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane! You were gone for 5 hours.</font>

289
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

290
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's weird.</font>

291
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Typical.</font>

292
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:12,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane.</font>

293
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. I just needed
to make sure you were real.</font>

294
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:19,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been a very strange day.</font>

295
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am. Jane, what...</font>

296
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where were you?</font>

297
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heimdall cannot see you.</font>

298
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was right here where you left me.</font>

299
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was waiting, and then I was crying</font>

300
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then I went out looking for you.</font>

301
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said you were coming back.</font>

302
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. I know,
but the Bifrost was destroyed.</font>

303
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Nine Realms erupted into chaos.</font>

304
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wars were raging,
marauders were pillaging.</font>

305
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to put an end to the slaughter.</font>

306
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:48,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As excuses go, it's not terrible.</font>

307
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I saw you on TV.
You were in New York!</font>

308
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane, I fought to protect you
from the dangers of my world</font>

309
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I was wrong.</font>

310
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was a fool.</font>

311
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:03,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I believe
that fate brought us together.</font>

312
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:08,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane, I don't know where you were,
or what happened, but I do know this...</font>

313
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

314
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know...</font>

315
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do?</font>

316
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do what?</font>

317
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:18,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

318
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:20,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

319
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:23,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this you?</font>

320
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, we're kind of
in the middle of something here.</font>

321
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, I'm pretty sure
we are getting arrested.</font>

322
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold that thought.</font>

323
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:38,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at you,
still all muscly and everything.</font>

324
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's space?</font>

325
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:42,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Space is fine.</font>

326
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

327
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you Jane Foster?
- Yes.</font>

328
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:46,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know this man?</font>

329
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's my intern.</font>

330
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My intern's intern.</font>

331
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is private property
and you're trespassing, the lot of you.</font>

332
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll have to come with me.</font>

333
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:01,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane.</font>

334
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jane.
- Thor?</font>

335
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:05,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you all right?</font>

336
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What just happened?</font>

337
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Place your hands
on your heads. Step back.</font>

338
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This woman is unwell.</font>

339
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's dangerous.</font>

340
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So am I.</font>

341
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Requesting armed response officers
to scene.</font>

342
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hold on to me.
- What are you doing?</font>

343
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.</font>

344
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to do that again.</font>

345
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:01,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

346
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to Asgard.</font>

347
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look upon my legacy, Algrim.</font>

348
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can barely remember a time
before the light.</font>

349
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our survival will be your legacy.</font>

350
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Asgardians will suffer
as we have suffered.</font>

351
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will reclaim the Aether.</font>

352
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:46,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will restore our world.</font>

353
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I will put an end
to this poisoned universe.</font>

354
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

355
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be still.</font>

356
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not of Earth. What is it?</font>

357
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:12,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We do not know.</font>

358
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:17,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But she will not survive the
amount of energy surging within her.</font>

359
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a quantum field generator,
isn't it?</font>

360
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a soul forge.</font>

361
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:30,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does a soul forge transfer molecular
energy from one place to another?</font>

362
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

363
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quantum field generator.</font>

364
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My words are mere noises to you
that you ignore them completely?</font>

365
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She is ill.</font>

366
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She is mortal.</font>

367
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:45,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Illness is their defining trait.</font>

368
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I brought her here
because we can help her.</font>

369
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She does not belong here in Asgard</font>

370
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">any more than a goat
belongs at a banquet table.</font>

371
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he just...</font>

372
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who do you think you are?</font>

373
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Odin, King of Asgard.</font>

374
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Protector of the Nine Realms.</font>

375
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Well, I'm...</font>

376
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:06,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know very well who you are,
Jane Foster.</font>

377
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:08,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You told your dad about me?</font>

378
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something is within her, Father.</font>

379
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something I have not seen before.</font>

380
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her world has its healers.</font>

381
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are called "doctors."
Let them deal with it.</font>

382
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guards, take her back to Midgard.</font>

383
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I would not...</font>

384
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...touch her.</font>

385
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:24,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane, are you all right?</font>

386
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

387
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's impossible.</font>

388
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The infection... It's defending her.</font>

389
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

390
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's defending itself.</font>

391
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come with me.</font>

392
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:46,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are relics
that pre-date the universe itself.</font>

393
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:50,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What lies within her
appears to be one of them.</font>

394
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Nine Realms are not eternal.</font>

395
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They had a dawn</font>

396
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as they will have a dusk.</font>

397
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But before that dawn</font>

398
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:05,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the dark forces, the Dark Elves,
reigned absolute and unchallenged.</font>

399
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Born of eternal night"</font>

400
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"the Dark Elves come
to steal away the light."</font>

401
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know these stories.
Mother told them to us as children.</font>

402
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their leader Malekith made a weapon
out of that darkness</font>

403
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:20,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it was called the Aether.</font>

404
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While the other relics
often appear as stones</font>

405
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Aether is fluid and everchanging.</font>

406
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It changes matter into dark matter.</font>

407
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It seeks out host bodies,
drawing strength from their life-force.</font>

408
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Malekith sought to use
the Aether's power</font>

409
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:41,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to return the universe
to one of darkness.</font>

410
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:44,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, after eternities of bloodshed</font>

411
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my father Bor finally triumphed</font>

412
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:51,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ushering in a peace
that lasted thousands of years.</font>

413
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:53,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened?</font>

414
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He killed them all.</font>

415
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you certain?</font>

416
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Aether was said to have
been destroyed with them,</font>

417
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:02,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and yet here it is.</font>

418
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Dark Elves are dead.</font>

419
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:10,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does your book happen to mention
how to get it out of me?</font>

420
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:11,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

421
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It does not.</font>

422
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The worlds are nearly aligned.</font>

423
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will be the last of the Kursed.</font>

424
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let my life be sacrificed.</font>

425
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:40,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is no less than our people did,</font>

426
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or you have done.</font>

427
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will become darkness,</font>

428
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:57,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">cursed to this existence
until it consumes you.</font>

429
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:06,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until then, no power our enemies
possess can stop you.</font>

430
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:16,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will tear down their defenses and
ensure your return to a universe reborn.</font>

431
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:41,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Acting as caretakers to these
scoundrels is beneath us.</font>

432
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, please!
If they were beneath you,</font>

433
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my rotund friend, they'd all be dead.</font>

434
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep in line!
Move it!</font>

435
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Odin continues to
bring me new friends.</font>

436
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How thoughtful.</font>

437
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:13,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The books I sent,
do they not interest you?</font>

438
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that how I am to while away eternity?
Reading?</font>

439
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:20,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've done everything in my power
to make you comfortable, Loki.</font>

440
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you?</font>

441
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does Odin share your concern?</font>

442
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does Thor?</font>

443
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:31,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It must be so inconvenient,
them asking after me day and night.</font>

444
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:34,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know full well it was your actions
that brought you here.</font>

445
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My actions?</font>

446
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was merely giving truth to the lie
that I had been fed my entire life...</font>

447
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That I was born to be a king.</font>

448
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A king?</font>

449
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A true king admits his faults.</font>

450
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What of the lives you took on Earth?</font>

451
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A mere handful
compared to the number</font>

452
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that Odin has taken himself.</font>

453
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Your father...
- He's not my father!</font>

454
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then am I not your mother?</font>

455
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not.</font>

456
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:14,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're always so perceptive
about everyone but yourself.</font>

457
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:33,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you came for me,
you knew I was in trouble.</font>

458
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heimdall had lost sight of you.</font>

459
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were no longer on Earth.</font>

460
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is that possible?</font>

461
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe you were and you weren't.</font>

462
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Nine Realms
travel within Yggdrasil</font>

463
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">orbiting Midgard much the way
your planets orbit the sun.</font>

464
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And every 5,000 years,
the worlds align perfectly</font>

465
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we call this the Convergence.</font>

466
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">During this time, the borders
between worlds become blurred.</font>

467
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's possible
you found one of these points.</font>

468
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are lucky that it remained open.</font>

469
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:10,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once the worlds pass out of alignment</font>

470
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then the connection is lost.</font>

471
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like the way you explain things.</font>

472
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going to happen to me?</font>

473
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll find a way to save you, Jane.</font>

474
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:38,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Your father said there was...
- My father doesn't know everything.</font>

475
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let him hear you say that.</font>

476
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane Foster...</font>

477
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please meet Frigga,</font>

478
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:46,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Queen of Asgard, and my mother.</font>

479
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

480
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move!</font>

481
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To the dungeons!</font>

482
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:30,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

483
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might want to take
the stairs to the left.</font>

484
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The prisons.</font>

485
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Loki...
- Go.</font>

486
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will look after her.</font>

487
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's as if they resent being imprisoned!</font>

488
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no pleasing some creatures.</font>

489
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Return to your cells,
no further harm will come to you.</font>

490
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have my word.</font>

491
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very well, you do not have my word.</font>

492
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Send a squadron
to the weapons vault.</font>

493
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Defend it at all costs.
Secure the dungeon.</font>

494
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Odin.
- Frigga.</font>

495
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:06,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

496
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a skirmish.</font>

497
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing to fear.</font>

498
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've never been a very good liar.</font>

499
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take her to your chambers.</font>

500
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:15,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll come for you when it's safe.</font>

501
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:17,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You take care.</font>

502
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:18,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Despite all I have survived,</font>

503
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my queen still worries over me.</font>

504
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's only because I worry over you</font>

505
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you have survived.</font>

506
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:28,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to me now.</font>

507
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to do everything I ask,
no questions.</font>

508
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am.</font>

509
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

510
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:47,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ow!
- Ah!</font>

511
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The throne of Asgard
is destroyed! To the king!</font>

512
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:02,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Frigga.</font>

513
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand down, creature,</font>

514
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you may still survive this.</font>

515
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have survived worse, woman.</font>

516
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:20,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

517
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Malekith.</font>

518
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:26,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I would have what is mine.</font>

519
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

520
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have taken something, child.</font>

521
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:01,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give it back.</font>

522
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:16,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Witch!</font>

523
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:21,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is the Aether?</font>

524
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll never tell you.</font>

525
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe you.</font>

526
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

527
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The universe rotates
on a 5,000-year cycle</font>

528
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:03,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and once a cycle, all the worlds align.</font>

529
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imagine... Imagine that this is our world.</font>

530
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, thank you. And this is another world.</font>

531
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Normally, they're separate.</font>

532
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But during the Alignment,</font>

533
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:17,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">everything is connected,
all nine realms.</font>

534
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All nine realms
are passing through each other</font>

535
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:21,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and gravity, light, and even matter,</font>

536
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is crashing from one world to the other.</font>

537
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:30,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if this happens to us now,
the result will be cataclysmic.</font>

538
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:35,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My gravimetric spikes can stabilize
the focal point of the Convergence.</font>

539
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This time, the Alignment</font>

540
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:41,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and all the other worlds
would just pass us by.</font>

541
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's beautiful.</font>

542
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's simple. Any questions?</font>

543
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

544
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:54,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I have my shoe back?</font>

545
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:06,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heal. You will need your strength
to reclaim the Aether.</font>

546
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:10,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when you wake,
we will kill them all.</font>

547
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:46,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane Foster?</font>

548
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to come with us.</font>

549
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:55,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are still unable to restore
the palace shields.</font>

550
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:56,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our artillery cannot detect them.</font>

551
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:58,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even Heimdall cannot see them.</font>

552
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:05,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My king, we are all but defenseless.</font>

553
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's your prisoner now?</font>

554
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:13,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave us.</font>

555
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do not wish to fight with you.</font>

556
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:27,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nor I with you.</font>

557
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I intend to pursue Malekith.</font>

558
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We possess the Aether.</font>

559
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Malekith will come to us.</font>

560
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, and he will destroy us.</font>

561
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You overestimate
the power of these creatures.</font>

562
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I value our people's lives.</font>

563
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take Jane to the Dark World,
and draw the enemy away from Asgard.</font>

564
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When Malekith
pulls the Aether from Jane,</font>

565
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it will be exposed and vulnerable.</font>

566
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I will destroy it and him.</font>

567
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you fail, you risk this weapon</font>

568
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">falling into the hands of our enemies.</font>

569
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:58,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The risk is far greater if we do nothing.</font>

570
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His ship could be over our heads
right now,</font>

571
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we would never even know it.</font>

572
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If and when he comes</font>

573
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:07,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">his men will fall
on 10,000 Asgardian blades.</font>

574
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how many of our men
shall fall on theirs?</font>

575
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:11,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As many as are needed!</font>

576
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:15,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

577
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will fight!</font>

578
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Till the last Asgardian breath.</font>

579
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:30,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Till the last drop of Asgardian blood.</font>

580
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then how are you different
from Malekith?</font>

581
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:42,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The difference, my son, is that I will win.</font>

582
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:59,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane isn't calling me back,
Erik isn't calling me back,</font>

583
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">stupid S.H.I.E.L.D.
isn't calling me back.</font>

584
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's S.H.I.E.L.D?
- It's a secret.</font>

585
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.</font>

586
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:08,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor came back,
he took Jane to Asgard,</font>

587
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:11,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do.</font>

588
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something else
went missing this week</font>

589
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:16,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig</font>

590
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:20,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">notable for his involvement
in the alien invasion of New York</font>

591
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">streaked nude across...</font>

592
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:24,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darcy,
you really need to look at this.</font>

593
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:26,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your friend, Erik...</font>

594
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was his last name again?</font>

595
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And began shouting at visitors
to the historic site.</font>

596
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:34,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was later taken into police custody</font>

597
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for psychiatric evaluation.</font>

598
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:39,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Police are still refusing to confirm...</font>

599
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were not at Odin's war council.</font>

600
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Bifrost is closed
by your father's orders.</font>

601
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one is to come</font>

602
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or to go.</font>

603
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We face an enemy
that is invisible even to me.</font>

604
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:06,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What use is a guardian such as that?</font>

605
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Malekith will return, you know this.</font>

606
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need your help.</font>

607
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot overrule my king's wishes.
Not even for you.</font>

608
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:19,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not asking you to.</font>

609
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The realms need their Allfather strong
and unchallenged</font>

610
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whether he is or not.</font>

611
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he is blinded, Heimdall</font>

612
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:28,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by hatred and by grief.</font>

613
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As are we all.</font>

614
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:31,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see clearly enough.</font>

615
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:33,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The risks are too great.</font>

616
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything we do from here on is a risk.</font>

617
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no other way.</font>

618
00:57:42,543 --> 00:57:44,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you require of me?</font>

619
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:48,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I'm about to ask of you
is treason of the highest order.</font>

620
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:52,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Success will bring us exile
and failure shall mean our death.</font>

621
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:59,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Malekith knew the Aether was here.
He can sense its power.</font>

622
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:02,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we do nothing,
he will come for it again</font>

623
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:06,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but this time, lay waste to all of Asgard.</font>

624
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must move Jane off-world.</font>

625
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Bifrost has been shut down</font>

626
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the Tesseract
locked away in the vault.</font>

627
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:17,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are other paths off Asgard.
Ways known only to a few.</font>

628
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One, actually.</font>

629
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

630
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:31,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor. After all this time</font>

631
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now you come to visit me.</font>

632
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

633
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you come to gloat? To mock?</font>

634
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loki, enough.</font>

635
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more illusions.</font>

636
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you see me, brother.</font>

637
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did she suffer?</font>

638
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did not come here to share our grief.</font>

639
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:10,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Instead I offer you the chance
of a far richer sacrament.</font>

640
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on.</font>

641
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you seek vengeance
as much as I do.</font>

642
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:18,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You help me escape Asgard
and I will grant it to you.</font>

643
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vengeance</font>

644
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and afterward, this cell.</font>

645
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:34,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must be truly desperate
to come to me for help.</font>

646
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:37,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What makes you think
you can trust me?</font>

647
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't.</font>

648
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:42,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mother did.</font>

649
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you should know that when
we fought each other in the past,</font>

650
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:48,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did so with a glimmer of hope</font>

651
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that my brother
was still in there somewhere.</font>

652
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That hope no longer exists
to protect you.</font>

653
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:58,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You betray me, and I will kill you.</font>

654
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

655
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:05,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When do we start?</font>

656
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:07,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He will betray you.</font>

657
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He will try.</font>

658
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is so unlike you, brother.</font>

659
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So clandestine.</font>

660
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:20,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure you wouldn't
rather just punch your way out?</font>

661
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:22,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you keep speaking, I just might.</font>

662
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:24,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine. As you wish.</font>

663
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:26,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not even here.</font>

664
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this better?</font>

665
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:31,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's better company at least.</font>

666
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:35,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still, we could be less conspicuous.</font>

667
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:39,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm, brother, you look ravishing.</font>

668
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:44,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will hurt no less
when I kill you in this form.</font>

669
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:47,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very well. Perhaps you
prefer one of your new companions</font>

670
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">given that you seem
to like them so much.</font>

671
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:52,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, this is much better.</font>

672
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh.</font>

673
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:56,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The costume is a bit much. So tight.</font>

674
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:58,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the confidence...</font>

675
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can feel the righteousness surging.</font>

676
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:03,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, do you want to have
a rousing discussion about truth?</font>

677
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:04,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honor? Patriotism?</font>

678
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:05,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God bless Amer...</font>

679
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:10,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

680
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could at least
furnish me with a weapon.</font>

681
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dagger, something.</font>

682
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:25,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At last.</font>

683
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little common sense.</font>

684
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:36,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I thought you liked tricks.</font>

685
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:40,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is
being guarded by a legion of Einherjar</font>

686
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who will see you coming
from miles away.</font>

687
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't be the one who comes for her.</font>

688
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:53,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not hungry.</font>

689
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the...</font>

690
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. Let's go.</font>

691
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:04,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're...</font>

692
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:06,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Loki, you may have heard of me.</font>

693
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was for New York.</font>

694
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:10,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like her.</font>

695
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:12,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what of the Allfather?</font>

696
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:17,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is my sworn duty to notify him
of crimes against the throne.</font>

697
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:20,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You called me here on an urgent matter.</font>

698
01:02:21,822 --> 01:02:22,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

699
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Treason, my lord.</font>

700
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:25,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whose?</font>

701
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mine.</font>

702
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:29,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My king!</font>

703
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The mortal has been taken.</font>

704
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:36,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop Thor.</font>

705
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By any means necessary.</font>

706
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There they are! Take them.</font>

707
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:45,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On my command.</font>

708
01:02:45,554 --> 01:02:47,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll hold them off. Take her.</font>

709
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

710
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:54,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Betray him, and I'll kill you.</font>

711
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good to see you, too, Sif.</font>

712
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:09,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Assuming you can get Loki's help
and you can free this mortal</font>

713
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:11,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what good would it do?</font>

714
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:14,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'd all be dead the minute
we step one foot outside the palace.</font>

715
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:17,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That, my friend,
is why we won't be leaving by foot.</font>

716
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will give you as much time as I can.</font>

717
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:25,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, my friend.</font>

718
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:32,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you even think about betraying him...</font>

719
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:34,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll kill me?</font>

720
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:36,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Evidently, there will be a line.</font>

721
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:53,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you said
you knew how to fly this thing.</font>

722
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:55,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said, "How hard could it be?"</font>

723
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:00,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're on the ship!</font>

724
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get to the ship!</font>

725
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:08,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, whatever you're doing, brother,
I suggest you do it faster.</font>

726
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:11,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up, Loki.</font>

727
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must have missed something.</font>

728
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:16,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I didn't.
I'm pressing every button on this thing.</font>

729
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:17,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, don't hit it. Just press it gently.</font>

730
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:19,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm pressing it gently, it's not working!</font>

731
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:23,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ha, ha!</font>

732
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:29,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get him! Get him!</font>

733
01:04:57,644 --> 01:05:00,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I think you missed a column.
- Shut up!</font>

734
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:08,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look,
why don't you let me take over?</font>

735
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:09,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm clearly the better pilot.</font>

736
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:12,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that right? Well, out of the two of us,</font>

737
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which one can actually fly?</font>

738
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:25,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, dear. Is she dead?</font>

739
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:27,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane.</font>

740
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:28,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm okay.</font>

741
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

742
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a word.</font>

743
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:40,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now they're following us.</font>

744
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now they're firing at us.</font>

745
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:48,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, thank you
for the commentary, Loki,</font>

746
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's not at all distracting!</font>

747
01:05:54,743 --> 01:05:57,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done.
You just decapitated your grandfather.</font>

748
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, this is wonderful.</font>

749
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:12,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a tremendous idea.</font>

750
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's steal the biggest,
most obvious ship in the universe</font>

751
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and escape in that.</font>

752
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:18,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flying around the city,</font>

753
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">smashing into everything in sight
so everyone can see us.</font>

754
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:22,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant!</font>

755
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:38,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see your time in the dungeons</font>

756
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has made you no less graceful, Loki.</font>

757
01:06:45,794 --> 01:06:47,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lied to me.</font>

758
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm impressed.</font>

759
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:51,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm glad you're pleased.</font>

760
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, do as you promised.</font>

761
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:54,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And take us to your secret pathway.</font>

762
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:19,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Fandral.
- Right.</font>

763
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:24,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For Asgard.</font>

764
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing personal, boys.</font>

765
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:47,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loki...</font>

766
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:51,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it were easy, everyone would do it.</font>

767
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you mad?
- Possibly.</font>

768
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ta-da!</font>

769
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must strike now.</font>

770
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

771
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:28,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Asgard is meaningless.</font>

772
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:34,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Aether has found its way home.</font>

773
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:54,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I could do with the power
that flows through those veins.</font>

774
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would consume you.</font>

775
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's holding up all right.</font>

776
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:01,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For now.</font>

777
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:04,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's strong in ways
you'd never even know.</font>

778
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:05,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say goodbye.</font>

779
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not this day.</font>

780
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:10,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This day, the next,
a hundred years, it's nothing.</font>

781
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a heartbeat.</font>

782
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll never be ready.</font>

783
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only woman
whose love you've prized</font>

784
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will be snatched from you.</font>

785
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:21,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And will that satisfy you?</font>

786
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Satisfaction is not in my nature.</font>

787
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:25,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surrender is not in mine.</font>

788
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The son of Odin...
- No.</font>

789
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not just of Odin.</font>

790
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you alone
were loved of Mother?</font>

791
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:34,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had her tricks, but I had her trust.</font>

792
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:35,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust?</font>

793
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:37,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was that her last expression?</font>

794
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:40,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust? When you let her die?</font>

795
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What help were you in your cell?
- Who put me there?</font>

796
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who put me there?</font>

797
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:46,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know damn well!</font>

798
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know damn well who!</font>

799
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She wouldn't want us to fight.</font>

800
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:01,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.</font>

801
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:08,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish I could trust you.</font>

802
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:24,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust my rage.</font>

803
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:34,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll have to sign
for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig.</font>

804
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:36,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

805
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:37,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font>

806
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:40,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father, Dr. Erik Selvig.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prescription medicine...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Various.</font>

811

- Erik.</font>

812
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- These.
- Yeah.</font>

813
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those.</font>

814
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank goodness.</font>

815
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Erik.</font>

816
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:07,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>

817
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's, uh, Darcy.</font>

818

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darcy.</font>

819
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So good to see you.</font>

820
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I missed you, too.</font>

821
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:17,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you find me?</font>

822
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:18,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were naked on TV.</font>

823
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:22,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, time to go, lots to do.</font>

824
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Getting weird now.</font>

825
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:30,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should not be left in charge
of stuff like this.</font>

826
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:34,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't get paid enough.
I don't get paid, period.</font>

827
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:37,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Ian by the way, uh, Darcy's intern.</font>

828
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I don't get paid either.</font>

829
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:41,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you all right?</font>

830
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:43,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've had a god in my brain.</font>

831
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't recommend it.</font>

832
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Selvig, sir,
your gear is beeping at me.</font>

833
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:52,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's happening.
It's sooner than I calculated.</font>

834
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. What's happening?</font>

835
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Birds?</font>

836
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:01,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Birds are happening?</font>

837
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're starlings.
It's called a murmuration.</font>

838
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dad, he used to take me
bird watching as a kid.</font>

839
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nerd.
- Look!</font>

840
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did they go?</font>

841
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell was that?</font>

842
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:31,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you smiling?</font>

843
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:32,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing more reassuring</font>

844
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:36,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than realizing that the world
is crazier than you are.</font>

845
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:39,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take me to Jane's lab.</font>

846
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane.</font>

847
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:01,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Malekith.</font>

848
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Are you ready?</font>

849
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am.</font>

850
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, this plan of yours
is going to get us killed.</font>

851
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:44,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, possibly.</font>

852
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:49,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still don't trust me, brother?</font>

853
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:52,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you?</font>

854
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:02,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I wouldn't.</font>

855
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor!</font>

856
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

857
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:23,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really think I cared about Frigga?</font>

858
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About any of you?</font>

859
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I ever wanted</font>

860
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:31,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was you and Odin</font>

861
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:32,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">dead at my feet!</font>

862
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:46,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Malekith!</font>

863
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Loki of Jotunheim,</font>

864
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I bring you a gift.</font>

865
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:56,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ask only one thing in return...</font>

866
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A good seat from which</font>

867
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to watch Asgard burn.</font>

868
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is an enemy of Asgard.</font>

869
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:05,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was a prisoner in their dungeons.</font>

870
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:20,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at me.</font>

871
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:20,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loki! Now!</font>

872
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:42,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

873
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:37,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

874
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:36,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ah!
- No!</font>

875
01:19:46,157 --> 01:19:48,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you in hell, monster.</font>

876
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no, no.</font>

877
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:13,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you fool, you didn't listen.</font>

878
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:14,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know...</font>

879
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:17,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a fool, I'm a fool.</font>

880
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:18,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay with me, okay?</font>

881
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:19,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

882
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:24,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Shh...</font>

883
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:25,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

884
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:30,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right.</font>

885
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:34,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell Father what you did here today.</font>

886
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't do it for him.</font>

887
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:51,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

888
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's going to unleash it.</font>

889
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:52,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not just on Asgard, or on a star.
Malekith is going to destroy everything.</font>

890
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:53,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How?</font>

891
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:55,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane, how?</font>

892
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:59,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw him on Earth.
Why would he go to Earth?</font>

893
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Convergence.</font>

894
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:02,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God.</font>

895
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:04,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of this would have happened
if I hadn't found the Aether.</font>

896
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:07,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then Malekith
would've only possessed it</font>

897
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:09,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that much sooner.</font>

898
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:12,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I only found it
because I was looking for you.</font>

899
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:13,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane...</font>

900
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:17,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we're trapped here.</font>

901
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:24,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not me.</font>

902
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:27,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

903
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:28,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Jane, it's Richard.</font>

904
01:22:28,986 --> 01:22:30,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Richard? Where are you?</font>

905
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm still at the office.</font>

906
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:34,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been a crazy day here today.</font>

907
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:36,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God, this is amazing.
- Is it?</font>

908
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:37,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I quite enjoyed our lunch</font>

909
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:39,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">despite never actually
ordering anything.</font>

910
01:22:39,747 --> 01:22:41,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How am I getting service here?</font>

911
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:43,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this a bad time?
Do you want me to try you later?</font>

912
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. Please, whatever
you do, do not hang up the phone.</font>

913
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:48,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, then.</font>

914
01:22:48,756 --> 01:22:51,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just wondering
if you want to try again.</font>

915
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:52,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, maybe dinner next time.</font>

916
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:54,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>

917
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just stay on the phone, okay?
- Yeah, I will.</font>

918
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

919
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:03,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I interrupting something?</font>

920
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:05,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. Nothing at all.</font>

921
01:23:05,773 --> 01:23:06,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

922
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:07,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm losing you there.
Are you in a tunnel?</font>

923
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:09,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are we going?</font>

924
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:10,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

925
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:12,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are there so many shoes in here?</font>

926
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:15,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll just text her.</font>

927
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:29,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, who's Richard?</font>

928
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

929
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:40,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jane!
- Hey.</font>

930
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:42,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't just leave like that.</font>

931
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:44,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whole world is going crazy.</font>

932
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:46,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the stuff we saw is spreading.</font>

933
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:49,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you go to a party?
- Erik?</font>

934
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:53,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane! How wonderful.</font>

935
01:23:54,113 --> 01:23:55,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

936
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You've been to Asgard.
- Where are your pants?</font>

937
01:23:57,408 --> 01:23:59,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, he, uh...
He says it helps him think.</font>

938
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:00,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, well, I'm going to need
everything you got on this.</font>

939
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:03,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the work you've been doing
on gravimetric anomalies, everything.</font>

940
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:04,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

941
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you well, Erik?</font>

942
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your brother's not coming, is he?</font>

943
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:11,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loki is dead.</font>

944
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:12,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, thank God!</font>

945
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:15,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I meant, I'm so sorry.</font>

946
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:17,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

947
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:43,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive me, my liege.</font>

948
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:46,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've returned from
the Dark World with news.</font>

949
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor?</font>

950
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:55,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was no sign of Thor,
or the weapon, but...</font>

951
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:58,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

952
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We found a body.</font>

953
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:08,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loki.</font>

954
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:14,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Malekith is going to
fire the Aether at a spot</font>

955
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:16,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where all the nine worlds
are connecting.</font>

956
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:19,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amplifying the weapon's impact.</font>

957
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:20,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For each additional world,</font>

958
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:22,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the power will increase exponentially.</font>

959
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:26,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The effect would be universal.</font>

960
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:27,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the Alignment is only temporary.</font>

961
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:30,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He must be in
exactly the right place at the right time.</font>

962
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:32,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, how do we know where that is?</font>

963
01:25:33,921 --> 01:25:36,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We follow the directions.</font>

964
01:25:36,507 --> 01:25:37,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This has happened before</font>

965
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:41,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">thousands of years ago,
and the Ancients were there to see it.</font>

966
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:43,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the great constructions,</font>

967
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:46,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Mayans, the Chinese,
the Egyptians.</font>

968
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:50,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They made use of the gravitational
effects of the Convergence.</font>

969
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they left us a map.</font>

970
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:53,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stonehenge,</font>

971
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:56,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Snowdon,</font>

972
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:57,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Great Orme.</font>

973
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:59,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are all coordinates taking us...</font>

974
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:02,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

975
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Greenwich?</font>

976
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:08,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The walls between worlds
will be almost non-existent.</font>

977
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:10,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Physics is going to go ballistic.</font>

978
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:12,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Increases and decreases in gravity,</font>

979
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:13,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">spatial extrusions.</font>

980
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:16,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The very fabric of reality
is going to be torn apart.</font>

981
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:21,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I better get my pants.</font>

982
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:24,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Focus! This is important.</font>

983
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to hammer them in
all around the site</font>

984
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:28,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then Jane and Erik
will activate them from the tower.</font>

985
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:30,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're taped together.</font>

986
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:33,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you even know
what these things do?</font>

987
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:35,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... No.</font>

988
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:36,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neither do I.</font>

989
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:42,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh!</font>

990
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:47,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, come on, come on!
- Right.</font>

991
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:01,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy...</font>

992
01:27:01,258 --> 01:27:02,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

993
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:15,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

994
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:23,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You needn't have come
so far, Asgardian.</font>

995
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:25,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Death would've come to you
soon enough.</font>

996
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not by your hand.</font>

997
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:29,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your universe was never meant to be.</font>

998
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:33,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your world and your family</font>

999
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will be extinguished!</font>

1000
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:38,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're running out of time.</font>

1001
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:41,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Almost there.
- Are you sure this is going to work?</font>

1002
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:44,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These devices were made
to detect anomalies, not cause them.</font>

1003
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:46,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on.</font>

1004
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:53,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Darcy.</font>

1005
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:05,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, with all that power,</font>

1006
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:07,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you'd hit harder.</font>

1007
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:34,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Done.</font>

1008
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:43,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Convergence
will be in full effect in 7 minutes.</font>

1009
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:45,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That just means we have to
keep Malekith busy for 8.</font>

1010
01:29:52,471 --> 01:29:54,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you might want to
hold on to something.</font>

1011
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:01,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is awesome!</font>

1012
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:02,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you do that?</font>

1013
01:30:03,065 --> 01:30:04,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, the gravitational fields</font>

1014
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:06,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">interact with the weak spots
between worlds, creating...</font>

1015
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:08,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, get the guy with the sword!</font>

1016
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:13,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oops.
- Let's go.</font>

1017
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:15,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

1018
01:30:15,494 --> 01:30:17,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell just happened?</font>

1019
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:18,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move!</font>

1020
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:38,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you all doing?</font>

1021
01:30:38,183 --> 01:30:39,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to get out of here, now!</font>

1022
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:41,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're joking, right?</font>

1023
01:30:41,645 --> 01:30:42,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Thor out there.</font>

1024
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's waving his hammer around
and everything!</font>

1025
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:45,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

1026
01:32:03,185 --> 01:32:04,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Confirming ship is hostile.</font>

1027
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:06,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Confirmed, ship is hostile.</font>

1028
01:32:06,813 --> 01:32:08,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have permission to engage.</font>

1029
01:32:08,315 --> 01:32:09,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roger.</font>

1030
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:10,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Missiles locked.</font>

1031
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:13,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Missiles away.</font>

1032
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:15,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Missiles off target.</font>

1033
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:18,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I repeat, target missed.
I'm losing control.</font>

1034
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:21,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mayday! Mayday! Lost positive control.</font>

1035
01:32:23,747 --> 01:32:24,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

1036
01:32:24,831 --> 01:32:26,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My signal's not connecting.</font>

1037
01:32:28,627 --> 01:32:29,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane!</font>

1038
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:30,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1039
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you all right?</font>

1040
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:15,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saved my life.</font>

1041
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:20,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1042
01:33:20,262 --> 01:33:21,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I did.</font>

1043
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:30,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

1044
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:31,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darcy?</font>

1045
01:33:32,065 --> 01:33:33,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane!</font>

1046
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:35,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ian!
- Selvig!</font>

1047
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:37,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mew mew!</font>

1048
01:33:40,824 --> 01:33:42,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind the gap.</font>

1049
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:45,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do I get to Greenwich?</font>

1050
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:49,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take this train. 3 stops.</font>

1051
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:53,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind the gap.</font>

1052
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:57,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. Sorry.</font>

1053
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:36,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're out of time.
- Jane.</font>

1054
01:34:37,797 --> 01:34:38,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane!</font>

1055
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:06,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor!</font>

1056
01:35:07,285 --> 01:35:08,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're too late.</font>

1057
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:11,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Convergence is at its peak.</font>

1058
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:13,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can those things stop him?</font>

1059
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:15,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not from here.</font>

1060
01:35:15,168 --> 01:35:17,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't get close enough.</font>

1061
01:35:19,005 --> 01:35:20,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can.</font>

1062
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:46,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Malekith!</font>

1063
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:57,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darkness returns, Asgardian.</font>

1064
01:35:57,335 --> 01:36:00,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you come
to witness the end of your universe?</font>

1065
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:02,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've come to accept your surrender.</font>

1066
01:36:22,318 --> 01:36:24,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you can stop this?</font>

1067
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:27,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Aether cannot be destroyed.</font>

1068
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you can.</font>

1069
01:37:15,246 --> 01:37:17,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor! No.</font>

1070
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:28,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane!</font>

1071
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:51,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

1072
01:37:59,332 --> 01:38:00,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody okay?</font>

1073
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:47,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gonna come back.</font>

1074
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:51,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except, you know,</font>

1075
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:54,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">last time he was gone for,
like, 2 years.</font>

1076
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:56,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's only been 2 days, so...</font>

1077
01:38:58,016 --> 01:38:59,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he say anything before he left?</font>

1078
01:38:59,976 --> 01:39:02,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, he had to figure
some stuff out with his father.</font>

1079
01:39:02,228 --> 01:39:06,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He kinda committed treason...
On our way out.</font>

1080
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:12,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

1081
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:19,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You once said there
would never be a wiser king than me.</font>

1082
01:39:19,704 --> 01:39:20,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were wrong.</font>

1083
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:25,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Alignment has brought
all the realms together.</font>

1084
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:28,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every one of them
saw you offer your life to save them.</font>

1085
01:39:29,047 --> 01:39:33,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What can Asgard offer
its new king in return?</font>

1086
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:36,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My life.</font>

1087
01:39:37,639 --> 01:39:40,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father, I cannot be king of Asgard.</font>

1088
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:45,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will protect Asgard and all the realms
with my last and every breath,</font>

1089
01:39:45,355 --> 01:39:47,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I cannot do so from that chair.</font>

1090
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:51,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loki, for all his grave imbalance,
understood rule as I know I never will.</font>

1091
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:55,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The brutality, the sacrifice...</font>

1092
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:57,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It changes you.</font>

1093
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:00,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd rather be a good man
than a great king.</font>

1094
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:06,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this my son I hear,
or the woman he loves?</font>

1095
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:08,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you speak,
do I never hear Mother's voice?</font>

1096
01:40:10,672 --> 01:40:13,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not for Jane, Father.</font>

1097
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:15,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She does not know
what I came here to say.</font>

1098
01:40:15,802 --> 01:40:19,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, forbid me to see her,
or say she can rule at my side.</font>

1099
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:20,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It changes nothing.</font>

1100
01:40:21,182 --> 01:40:24,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One son
who wanted the throne too much,</font>

1101
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:27,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">another who will not take it.</font>

1102
01:40:28,106 --> 01:40:29,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this my legacy?</font>

1103
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:31,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loki died with honor.</font>

1104
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:33,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shall try to live the same.</font>

1105
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:35,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that not legacy enough?</font>

1106
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:48,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It belongs to you.</font>

1107
01:40:49,544 --> 01:40:51,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you are worthy of it.</font>

1108
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:53,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shall try to be.</font>

1109
01:40:55,299 --> 01:41:00,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot give you my blessing,
nor can I wish you good fortune.</font>

1110
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:02,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

1111
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:08,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I were proud of
the man my son had become,</font>

1112
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:11,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">even that, I could not say.</font>

1113
01:41:14,152 --> 01:41:17,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would speak only from my heart.</font>

1114
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:20,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go,</font>

1115
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:23,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my son.</font>

1116
01:41:25,288 --> 01:41:26,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Father.</font>

1117
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:43,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1118
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1119
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:06,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I present to you,</font>

1120
01:44:07,325 --> 01:44:10,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.</font>

1121
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:13,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa...</font>

1122
01:44:16,584 --> 01:44:21,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Asgardians, it's an honor.</font>

1123
01:44:24,842 --> 01:44:26,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know why we're here.</font>

1124
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:32,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

1125
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:35,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, if I may ask,</font>

1126
01:44:35,811 --> 01:44:39,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">why not keep it secure
in your own vault?</font>

1127
01:44:39,815 --> 01:44:42,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Tesseract is already on Asgard.</font>

1128
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:46,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is not wise to keep
2 Infinity Stones so close together.</font>

1129
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:49,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's very wise.</font>

1130
01:44:59,377 --> 01:45:00,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can assure you,</font>

1131
01:45:02,004 --> 01:45:07,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it will be absolutely safe here,</font>

1132
01:45:09,428 --> 01:45:11,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in my collection.</font>

1133
01:45:13,099 --> 01:45:15,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See that it is.</font>

1134
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:36,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 down.</font>

1135
01:45:38,082 --> 01:45:40,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 to go.</font>
