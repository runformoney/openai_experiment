1
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:16,016
My name is Taika Waititi.

2
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,853
W-A-I-T-I-T-I.

3
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:24,107
My first name, Taika,
like tiger, but Taika.

4
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,400
Spelt the same,

5
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,861
except get rid of the
replace that with a

6
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,697
and get rid of the "ER"
and you put and "A" instead

7
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,450
in the front part.
The "T" remains the same obviously.

8
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,701
And then you just add...

9
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:37,663
You slip a little "A"
in between the "T" and the

10
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,456
Cut. Action. Action.

11
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,114
WAITITI: All right, here we go.

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,380
Cut. You got it. One more for good luck.

13
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,690
<i>You did great today. Well done.</i>

14
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,216
<i>Good. Cut.</i>

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,302
<i>BRAD WINDERBAUM: Taika is a dream director.</i>

16
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,638
He is great at expressing himself.

17
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,598
<i>Everyone, attention, please.</i>

18
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,162
- (RINGING)
- Great. Hey, excellent...

19
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,226
There, right.

20
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,029
The tables are turning.
Thor starts winning.

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,689
Falling, falling, falling and crash.

22
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,066
- He's an amazing talent.
- Cut.

23
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,150
So cool.

24
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:10,737
He is by far the most wacky
and physical director

25
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,073
<i>that I have ever worked with.</i>

26
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,158
I carry this around while I'm directing,

27
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,035
<i>and it demands respect.</i>

28
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,706
Good.

29
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,849
<i>CATE BLANCHETT:
The minute you meet him,</i>

30
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,126
you just think,
<i>"I'll</i> do anything for you."

31
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,210
(BOTH LAUGHING)

32
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,213
He's great. He's quite a character.

33
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:31,675
I think that up until my arrival
in Thor's universe,

34
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:37,973
it has been lacking the presence of
someone who takes the world seriously.

35
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,057
(BOTH LAUGHING)

36
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,732
Marvel has a great tradition
of hiring really exciting filmmakers

37
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:50,944
<i>that can bring new life
into these superhero movies.</i>

38
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:53,905
Ah...

39
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,994
This is a guy who is not only
a great storyteller

40
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,954
<i>with a great visual sense,</i>

41
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,498
<i>but also, he's really funny.</i>

42
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,791
(LAUGHING)

43
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,378
What's good about Taika is his humor.

44
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,506
<i>It's so particular
and unique and quirky.</i>

45
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,343
<i>There's just this natural buoyancy
with the way that he thinks.</i>

46
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:17,387
There's no continuity
when you're livin' in the moment!

47
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,681
- MAN: We're still rolling.
- We're still rolling?

48
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,683
- I said cut.
- MAN: Did you?

49
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,894
- In my mind.
- (LAUGHTER)

50
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,271
He just has such a sense of play

51
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,231
<i>and is so spirited.</i>

52
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,983
<i>He's just a big kid, basically.</i>

53
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,569
So just goofing around on the set
of Ragnarok.

54
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,030
- So much fun on the set. Thor 3.
- (LAUGHTER)

55
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,324
The best directors,
they have to be the boss.

56
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,619
They have to tell you what they want,
put you in the frame, so to speak.

57
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,998
<i>And he is in command,
but he is so open to suggestions.</i>

58
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,959
"Just can I try this?"
"Yeah, go for it, mate. Go for it."

59
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,961
<i>So I do things which are so outlandish.</i>

60
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,965
Jolly happy hour!
Have a mead, have some fun.

61
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,009
Taika is a collaborator.

62
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,345
<i>And it's really wonderful
to turn up to work</i>

63
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,472
<i>and know that you're in it together.</i>

64
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:04,518
He seems to, and everybody warned me,
you know,

65
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,437
<i>provide leadership
in this special atmosphere,</i>

66
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:11,108
<i>creative and fertile and welcoming.
And he's enjoying himself.</i>

67
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,275
Yeah. (LAUGHING)

68
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:16,238
He has such a compassion and
understanding for the actor's process.

69
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,990
And that's gonna stack up with that.
I think what it is,

70
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,826
is you take a half... Exactly.

71
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,762
- So you stay on your line.
- Stay on your line.

72
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,497
Look at this. You just come over
a touch. Okay, good.

73
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,668
And you boom, confuse, punch
and you jump over it.

74
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,128
Those are my instructions.

75
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,755
MARK <i>RUFFALO:
He's super smart.</i>

76
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,881
(LAUGHTER)

77
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,050
And he's a physical genius.

78
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,387
As you can see here,
he looks completely inept

79
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,933
<i>and totally inexperienced in fighting,
which is true for Chris Hemsworth,</i>

80
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,476
but obviously not for Thor.

81
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,230
(CHANTING)

82
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,982
I come from humble background.

83
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,527
<i>I'm more well-known
for independent storytelling,</i>

84
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,820
or storytelling on a budget.

85
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,799
<i>JAKE</i> MORRISON: <i>In independent film
world, you have to do everything.</i>

86
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:00,866
Yeah!

87
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,910
So he already understands cameras,
he understands lighting

88
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,997
<i>and understands blocking and set design,
and props and set deck.</i>

89
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,208
He can wear costumes.
He likes wearing the costumes.

90
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,669
Who just got replaced?

91
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,465
Every single costume you're seeing,
he's worn it.

92
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,468
They pitched this, uh, as a costume
for an extra.

93
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,679
<i>And I'm trying it on,
I wear it all day long,</i>

94
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,098
<i>and if it passes my test,
it will go on to an extra.</i>

95
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,601
<i>So tomorrow I'll try
a different costume for another extra.</i>

96
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,436
And we've got 5,000 extras.

97
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,188
MAN: Get back!

98
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,652
(GROWLING)

99
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,365
Hey, man. My name is Korg.
I'm kind of like the leader in here.

100
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,994
I'm made of rocks, as you can see,
but don't let that intimidate you.

101
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,331
You don't need to be afraid, unless
you're made of scissors. (CHUCKLES)

102
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:53,752
Korg is played by Taika Waititi,
who's an incredible actor.

103
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,464
It's so funny, 'cause I kept saying,
"You gotta play someone in this film.

104
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,549
<i>"Who're you gonna play?
What're you gonna do?"</i>

105
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,094
Good luck in your fight today, Thor.
We believe that you can do it.

106
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,388
I don't think he can do it.

107
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,433
His character's
extremely fascinating to me.

108
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:13,814
<i>He's a giant man made of rock
and stone and granite and opal.</i>

109
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,525
And who knows what's beyond that?
Is it flesh and blood?

110
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:17,668
(SOFTLY) Or just more stones?

111
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,486
What about you? You're made of rocks.

112
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,239
Perishable rock. There you go.
Another one gone.

113
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,032
Korg's 100% digital.

114
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,619
<i>When we had Taika perform this stuff,
we had him with the head-mounted cameras</i>

115
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,763
and Taika's giving it his all.

116
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,705
Ah, yeah, no,
this whole thing is a circle.

117
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,792
But not a real circle.
More like a freaky circle.

118
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,210
This doesn't make any sense.

119
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,046
No, it doesn't make any sense.
Nothing makes sense to you.

120
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,132
You're in a sort of
sense deprivation zone.

121
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,177
<i>HEMSWORTH: Having him as an actor
standing opposite you</i>

122
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,598
as well as being the director
is a fairly unique kind of thing.

123
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,183
Let's just do the walk from here now.

124
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,893
A motion capture suit? What is that?

125
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:55,272
<i>Pajamas with triangles all over them,
ping-pong balls.</i>

126
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,774
<i>It's very hard
to be taken seriously as a director</i>

127
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,442
<i>when you're wearing that stuff.</i>

128
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:00,902
(LAUGHTER)

129
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,614
As a director, I think
Taika's a fantastic actor to work with.

130
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,451
<i>He's very generous to other actors,
he's very professional.</i>

131
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,413
<i>There's something very special about him
and I wanna see him go far.</i>

132
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,747
As Taika the actor,

133
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,625
<i>I think Taika the director
is incredibly generous.</i>

134
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,587
<i>He often gives Taika the actor
a lot of time to get it right,</i>

135
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,297
<i>a lot of time to learn his lines.</i>

136
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,632
<i>While he's acting,
he gives him a lot of takes.</i>

137
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,218
The relationship between the two Taikas

138
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:29,556
is actually, um, fascinating
for other people to watch.

139
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,310
Infuriating for producers to watch,
but fascinating for the crew.

140
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,936
Get on the spaceship!

141
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,938
There's a kitchen just to the left.

142
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,942
You go down the stairs to the right,
a big bedroom.

143
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,986
It's not very hygienic.

144
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:49,200
One of the bittersweet experiences
of acting in this film

145
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:53,914
was taking all of those Thor fans
and turning them into Korg fans.

146
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:58,919
Thunder, Thunder, Thunder, Thunder!

147
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:03,131
And I don't know what will happen
to the Thor franchise because of that.

148
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,091
Miek, where are you from?

149
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,469
- Oh, Miek's dead.
- Oh.

150
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,138
Yeah, no, I accidentally stomped on him
on the bridge.

151
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:14,726
All I can say is
what the world needs right now is Korg,

152
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,852
the rock man.

153
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,314
