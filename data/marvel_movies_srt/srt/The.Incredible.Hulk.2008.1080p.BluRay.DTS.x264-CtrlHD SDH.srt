And then something hit us, something...

171
00:27:24,327 --> 00:27:27,163
Something big hit us!

Are you hurt? Let me help you.

802
01:37:01,864 --> 01:37:03,741
I'm all right. Just find a way out.

803
01:37:06,035 --> 01:37:07,369
(GROWLING)

804
01:37:16,754 --> 01:37:18,130
(CHUCKLING)

805
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:58,254
You don't deserve this power!
Now watch her die!

806
01:38:15,437 --> 01:38:16,939
(BOTH GRUNTING)

807
01:38:48,971 --> 01:38:50,639
Look out!

808
01:39:21,462 --> 01:39:22,713
General?

809
01:39:28,969 --> 01:39:31,555
Any last words?

810
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:37,770
Hulk smash!

811
01:40:23,399 --> 01:40:25,234
(ROARING)

812
01:40:25,317 --> 01:40:26,902
BETTY: Stop!

813
01:40:57,183 --> 01:40:58,434
(ROARING)

814
01:41:47,650 --> 01:41:48,984
It's okay.

815
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:00,788
Betty.

816
01:42:09,839 --> 01:42:11,131
(GROWLING)

817
01:42:46,292 --> 01:42:48,043
(SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)

818
01:44:02,827 --> 01:44:04,370
(HEART BEATING)

819
01:44:09,625 --> 01:44:11,502
(HEART BEATING RAPIDLY)

820
01:44:28,811 --> 01:44:30,146
GENERAL: Reload.

821
01:44:37,695 --> 01:44:38,904
Reload.

822
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:58,090
TONY STARK: The smell of stale beer and defeat.

823
01:44:58,174 --> 01:44:59,925
You know, I hate to say,
"I told you so," General,

824
01:45:00,009 --> 01:45:04,430
but that Super Soldier programme
was put on ice for a reason.

825
01:45:04,513 --> 01:45:07,391
I've always felt hardware was more reliable.

826
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,894
- Stark.
- General.

827
01:45:12,229 --> 01:45:14,732
You always wear such nice suits.

828
01:45:15,691 --> 01:45:17,026
STARK: Touché.

829
01:45:17,943 --> 01:45:21,655
- I hear you have an unusual problem.
- You should talk.

830
01:45:21,739 --> 01:45:23,240
You should listen.

831
01:45:25,910 --> 01:45:29,413
STARK: What if I told you
we were putting a team together?

832
01:45:29,497 --> 01:45:31,081
Who's "we"?
