1
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:43,218
Things are never
gonna be the same now.

2
00:00:43,313 --> 00:00:44,926
I mean, look at this.

3
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:46,830
We got aliens.

4
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:50,533
We got big green guys
tearing down buildings.

5
00:00:50,935 --> 00:00:54,004
When I was a kid, 
I used to draw cowboys and Indians.

6
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:57,908
Actually, it's native American,
but whatever.

7
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,714
Yeah.
Tell you what, though.

8
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:03,781
It ain't bad, is it?

9
00:01:04,283 --> 00:01:05,549
No. Yeah.

10
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:07,718
Kid's got a future.

11
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,687
Yeah, well...

12
00:01:10,389 --> 00:01:12,122
we'll see, I guess.

13
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:37,981
No, hey! Ah!

14
00:01:38,383 --> 00:01:40,384
You can't saw through that stuff.

15
00:01:40,986 --> 00:01:42,952
These alien bastards are tough.

16
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:45,323
You gotta use
the stuff they use.

17
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:49,761
- See? All right.
- All right.

18
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,664
Oh, hey!

19
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:55,865
Glad you could join us.
Afternoon.

20
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,435
- Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
- Yeah, your alarm.

21
00:01:58,637 --> 00:02:01,705
Look, just go stack that armor
plating like I asked you.

22
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:03,540
This is a huge deal for us.

23
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:04,874
Attention, please!

24
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:07,977
In accordance
with executive order 396-b,

25
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,846
all post-battle cleanup operations

26
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:11,981
are now under our jurisdiction.

27
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:14,451
Thank you for your service.
We'll take it from here.

28
00:02:14,453 --> 00:02:15,552
Who the hell are you?

29
00:02:15,854 --> 00:02:16,987
Qualified personnel.

30
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:19,622
Look, I have a city contract

31
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:21,791
to salvage all this, okay,
with the city, so...

32
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:24,728
I apologize, Mr. Toomes,
but all salvage operations

33
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,096
are now under our jurisdiction.

34
00:02:26,498 --> 00:02:28,865
Please turn over any
and all exotic materials

35
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:31,768
that you've collected
or you will be prosecuted.

36
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,403
Ma'am, what if...

37
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:36,507
Please. Come here.
Hey, lady, come on.

38
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:38,075
Look...

39
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:41,010
I bought trucks for this job.

40
00:02:41,212 --> 00:02:42,512
I brought in a whole new crew.

41
00:02:42,514 --> 00:02:44,948
These guys have a family.
I have a family.

42
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,384
I'm all in on this.
I could lose my house.

43
00:02:47,386 --> 00:02:50,454
I'm sorry, sir.
There's nothing I can do.

44
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:53,757
Maybe next time,
don't overextend yourself.

45
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:56,927
What'd you say?

46
00:02:58,796 --> 00:02:59,940
Yeah.

47
00:03:00,231 --> 00:03:02,665
He's right.
I overextended myself.

48
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:04,801
<i>- Hey, hey, hey.
- Don't do it.</i>

49
00:03:04,803 --> 00:03:09,239
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
Put 'em down.

50
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:11,474
If you have a grievance,

51
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:13,476
you may take it up
with my superiors.

52
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:16,078
Your superiors.
Who the hell are they?

53
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,448
<i>A joint venture

58

Hey, chief!

63
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:39,135
We still have another load
from yesterday.

64
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:41,081
We're supposed
to turn this in, right?

65
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:43,106
- I ain't hauling it.
- It's too bad.

66
00:03:43,908 --> 00:03:46,977
We could have made some cool
stuff from all that alien junk.

67

I tell you what.

68

Let's keep it.

69

The world's changing.

70
00:04:00,357 --> 00:04:02,425
It's time we change too.

Just making a little video of the trip.</i>

to the bathroom before?</i>

84

<i>There's a bathroom on it.</i>

That's awesome.</i>

just happened.</i>

134
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:56,926

Something skimpy, I hope.</i>

142

<i>Peter, that's inappropriate.</i>

143

<i>That a private conversation.</i>

156
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,605
<i>I don't like joking about this.
It was hard for me to talk to you about.</i>

157
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:43,940
<i>No, seriously,
was he snoring a bunch?</i>

158
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:46,376
<i>- Here we are. End of the line.
- Whoops.</i>

159
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:50,479
<i>-Happy, can you give us a moment?
- You want me to leave the car?</i>

160
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:52,081
<i>just grab Peter's case
out of the trunk.</i>

161
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:55,218
I can keep the suit?

162
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,788
Yes, we were
just talking about it.

163
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,022
Do me a favor, though.

164
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:01,691
Happy's kind of
your point guy on this.

165
00:09:01,693 --> 00:09:03,860
Just don't stress him out.
Don't do anything stupid.

166
00:09:04,062 --> 00:09:06,006
I've seen his cardiogram.

167
00:09:06,197 --> 00:09:07,930
- All right?
- Yes!

168
00:09:07,932 --> 00:09:09,165
Don't do anything I would do,

169
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:11,167
and definitely don't do anything
i wouldn't do.

170
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:14,570
There's a little gray area in there.
And there's where you operate.

171
00:09:14,572 --> 00:09:15,938
Wait, does that mean
I'm an avenger?

172
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,006
No.

173
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:19,008
- This it?
- Seventh floor.

174
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,643
I can take that.
You don't have to.

175
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:22,646
- You gonna take it?
- Yeah, I can take that.

176
00:09:22,648 --> 00:09:23,648
Thank you.

177
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,215
So when's our next...?

178
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:28,350
When's our next "retreat",
you know?

179
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:29,418
What, next mission?

180
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,920
Yeah, the mission, the missions.

181
00:09:30,922 --> 00:09:33,222
- We'll call you.
- Do you have my numbers?

182
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:34,523
No, I mean, we'll call you.

183
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:36,759
Like, someone will call you.
All right?

184
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:38,828
- From your team.
- Okay. All right.

185
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,896
That's not a hug.
I'm just grabbing the door for you.

186
00:09:40,898 --> 00:09:42,833
We're not there yet.

187
00:09:45,402 --> 00:09:46,369
Bye.

188
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:53,510
They'll call me...

189
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:04,565
<font color="#00ff00">H</font>

What's up, penis Parker?

252
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:50,432
<i>Rise and shine,
Midtown Science and Technology.</i>

253
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:53,001
<i>Students, don't forget
about your homecoming tickets.</i>

254
00:10:53,003 --> 00:10:54,937
<i>Do you have a date
for homecoming?</i>

255
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:56,973
<i>Thanks, Jason,
but I already have a date.</i>

256
00:10:56,975 --> 00:10:59,176
<i>- Okay.
- Yeah.</i>

257
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:09,485
Damn it!
You, in my office right now.

258
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:29,405
Join me, and together

259
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,275
we'll build
my new LEGO death star.

260
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:34,677
- What?
- So lame.

261
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,579
No way. That's awesome.
How many pieces?

262
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:38,815
3830.

263
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:40,616
- That's insane.
- I know.

264
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:42,051
You want to build it tonight?

265
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:43,953
No, I can't tonight.
I've got the Stark...

266
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:46,289
- Mm-hm. Stark internship.
- Yeah, exactly.

267
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,590
Always got that internship.

268
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:48,658
Yeah, well, hopefully,

269
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,493
soon it'll lead
to a real job with them.

270
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:52,394
- That would be so sweet.
- Right?

271
00:11:52,396 --> 00:11:54,797
He'd be all, "good job
on those spreadsheets, Peter.

272
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,043
Here's a gold coin."

273
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:59,502
- I don't know how jobs work.
- That's exactly how they work.

274
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:03,606
I'll knock out the basic bones
of the death star at my place.

275
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:04,940
and then i'll come by afterwards.

276
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:07,509
<i>For the most part, the difficult
thing is the base of it.</i>

277
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:09,779
<i>The top half we can knock out
in two hours, tops.</i>

278
00:12:12,616 --> 00:12:14,150
That'd be great.

279
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:17,053
Okay, so how do we calculate

280
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:20,657
linear acceleration
between points A and B?

281
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:22,191
Flash.

282
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:24,193
It's the product
of sine of the angle

283
00:12:24,195 --> 00:12:25,561
and gravity divided by the mass.

284
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:26,230
Nope.

285
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:27,577
Peter.

286
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:29,399
You still with us?

287
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:32,235
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah.

288
00:12:32,237 --> 00:12:33,102
Uh...

289
00:12:33,604 --> 00:12:37,006
Mass cancels out,
so it's just gravity times sine.

290
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:38,741
Right. See, flash,
being the fastest

291
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:41,010
isn't always the best
if you are wrong.

292
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,046
You're dead.

293
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:50,353
Today we're talking about
Danish physicist Niels Bohr,

294
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:53,622
but trust me,
there's nothing bohr-ing

295
00:12:53,624 --> 00:12:57,727
about his discoveries
regarding quantum theory.

296
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:09,171
- Did Liz get a new top?
- No.

297
00:13:09,173 --> 00:13:12,475
We've seen that before,
but never with that skirt.

298
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:15,344
- Liz, hey. That looks so good.
- Hi!

299
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:18,481
We should probably stop staring
before it gets creepy.

300
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,650
Too late.
You guys are losers.

301
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:24,220
Well, then why
do you sit with us?

302
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:25,922
Because I don't have any friends.

303
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:29,692
Let's move to the next question.

304
00:13:29,694 --> 00:13:32,428
What is the heaviest
naturally-occurring element?

305
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,530
Hydrogen's the lightest.

306
00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:37,166
That's not
the question. Okay. Yeah.

307
00:13:37,168 --> 00:13:38,201
Uranium.

308
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:40,002
That is correct.
Thank you, Abraham.

309
00:13:40,204 --> 00:13:42,471
Please open your books to page 10.

310
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:44,373
Peter, it's nationals.

311
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,075
Is there no way
you could take one weekend off?

312
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,378
I can't go to Washington.
If Mr. Stark needs me,

313
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,079
Then I have to make sure I'm here.

314
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,649
You've never been
in the same room as Tony Stark.

315
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:55,117
Wait.
What's happening?

316
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,552
Peter's not going to Washington.

317
00:13:56,554 --> 00:13:59,422
- No. No, no, no.
- Why not?

318
00:13:59,624 --> 00:14:01,257
Really?
Right before nationals?

319
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:04,094
He already quit marching band
and robotics lab.

320
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,830
I'm not obsessed with him.
Just very observant.

321
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:09,598
Flash, you're in for Peter.

322
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,501
- Uh, I don't know.
- I gotta check my calendar first.

323
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:14,804
I got a hot date
with black widow coming up.

324
00:14:15,306 --> 00:14:16,750
That is false.

325
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:19,743
What'd I tell you about using
the bell for comedic purposes?

326
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:38,595
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, man.

327
00:14:40,765 --> 00:14:42,431
What's up, Mr. delmar?

328
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:43,866
Hey, Mr. Parker.

329
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:45,167
Number five, right?

330
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:46,435
Yeah, and with pickles,

331
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:48,838
and can you smush it down
real flat? Thanks.

332
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,239
You got it, boss.

333
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,574
How's your aunt?

334
00:14:52,376 --> 00:14:53,676
Yeah, she's all right.

335
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,800
<font color="#ffff00"><i>"La bella donna italiana bellissima"</i></font>
She's a very hot italian woman.

336
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
<font color="#ffff00"><i>"Como estas tua figlia?"</i></font>
How's your daughter?

337
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:04,320
- Ten dollars.
- It's $5.

338
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:05,388
For that comment, $10.

339
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,458
Hey, come on.
I'm joking. I'm joking.

340
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,793
Here's $5.

341
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:13,296
What's up, Murph?

342
00:15:13,298 --> 00:15:14,932
<i>How you doing, buddy?</i>

343
00:15:16,934 --> 00:15:18,300
So how's school?

344
00:15:18,302 --> 00:15:20,669
Ah, you know. It's boring.
Got better things to do.

345
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:22,671
Stay in school, kid.
Stay in school.

346
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:24,607
Otherwise,
you're gonna end up like me.

347
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:28,111
This is great.
Best sandwiches in queens.

348
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,415
Finally.

349
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:44,120
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

350
00:16:44,722 --> 00:16:46,723
Could you hold this for a second?
Thanks.

351
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:51,493
Hey, is this anybody's bike?
No?

352
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:54,396
- Hey, buddy, is this your bike?
- I have no change.

353
00:16:54,898 --> 00:16:56,766
Does anyone have a pen?
Do you have a pen?

354
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:02,572
Everybody good?

355
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:09,812
Hey!

356
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:12,815
You're that spider guy
on YouTube, right?

357
00:17:12,817 --> 00:17:14,061
Call me spider-man!

358
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:17,153
Okay, Spider-man.
Do a flip!

359
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:20,356
- Yeah!
- Not bad.

360
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,070
Hey, buddy.

361
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,541
- Shouldn't steal cars, it's bad.
- It's my car, dumbass!

362
00:17:38,543 --> 00:17:39,809
Hey! Shut that off!

363
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:42,044
- I was just tried...
- Can you tell him it's my car?

364
00:17:42,046 --> 00:17:45,314
- Yo! I work at nights. Come on.
- That's not your car!

365
00:17:45,316 --> 00:17:46,915
- That's his car.
- How was I supposed to know his car?

366
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:50,052
- He put that in the window!
- Every day with these damn alarms!

367
00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:53,355
- Turn it off!
- Don't make me come down there.

368
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:55,724
Hey, Gary! How you doing?

369
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:58,560
Marjorie, how are you?
How's your mother?

370
00:18:04,702 --> 00:18:06,901
I'm good, I'm good.

371
00:18:07,103 --> 00:18:09,405
<i>You have reached
the voicemail box of...</i>

372
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:10,906
<i>Happy hogan.</i>

373
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:13,542
Hey, Happy.
Here's my report for tonight.

374
00:18:13,544 --> 00:18:14,910
I stopped a grand theft bicycle.

375
00:18:14,912 --> 00:18:17,346
Couldn't find the owner,
so I just left a note.

376
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:18,180
Um...

377
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:20,949
I helped this lost,
old Dominican lady.

378
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:24,353
She was really nice
and bought me a churro.

379
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:27,423
I just feel like
i could be doing more.

380
00:18:27,825 --> 00:18:29,258
You know?
Just curious when the next

381
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,759
real mission's gonna be.

382
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:33,696
Cheers, just call me back.

383
00:18:33,698 --> 00:18:36,966
It's Peter. Parker.

384
00:18:40,804 --> 00:18:43,206
Why would I tell him
about the churro?

385
00:18:46,344 --> 00:18:49,613
Oh. Unh.
Hey, hey. Oh! Ah.

386
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:54,551
Okay.

387
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,753
<i>Can't wait to see this thing, man.</i>

388
00:18:57,755 --> 00:18:59,790
Finally, something good.

389
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,960
Yo, this high-tech stuff
makes it too easy.

390
00:19:05,162 --> 00:19:07,531
- Told you it was worth it.
- Okay, go, go, go.

391
00:19:12,302 --> 00:19:13,302
Oh, nice.

392
00:19:14,004 --> 00:19:16,440
We can hit, like,
five more places tonight.

393
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,450
Ehmm...
What's up, guys?

394
00:19:28,452 --> 00:19:29,953
You forget your pin number?

395
00:19:30,555 --> 00:19:31,887
Ohhhh...
You're the avengers.

396
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:34,923
What are you guys doing here?

397
00:19:35,992 --> 00:19:39,261
Thor. Hulk.
Good to finally meet you guys.

398
00:19:39,863 --> 00:19:41,530
I thought you'd be more handsome
in person.

399
00:19:42,085 --> 00:19:42,785
Iron man?

400
00:19:42,832 --> 00:19:45,368
Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank?
You're a billionaire.

401
00:19:48,405 --> 00:19:49,205
Hey...

402
00:19:49,507 --> 00:19:52,541
Oh, this feels so weird.

403
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:55,444
What is that thing?

404
00:19:56,046 --> 00:20:00,049
I'm starting... To think...
You're not... The avengers!

405
00:20:04,086 --> 00:20:05,354
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

406
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:08,624
Uh, spider-man is
fighting the avengers

407
00:20:08,726 --> 00:20:10,292
in a bank on 21st street.

408
00:20:10,594 --> 00:20:13,596
All right guys, let's wrap this up.
It's a school night.

409
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,302
So how do jerks like you
get tech like this?

410
00:20:20,938 --> 00:20:23,572
No. Wait, wait, wait!
Ah!

411
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:29,878
Mr. Delmar.

412
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,049
Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here?
Is anybody in here? Hello?

413
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,927
Oh, what is that.

414
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,430
I gotta...

415
00:20:48,732 --> 00:20:51,267
- Here, here.
- Good, yeah.

416
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:54,603
Okay. Good. Yes.

417
00:20:54,605 --> 00:20:55,938
Yeah... no.
No, put that down.

418
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,107
That's worth more
than you or me.

419
00:20:58,744 --> 00:20:59,485
Yeah?

420
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:01,176
Happy, the craziest thing
just happened to me.

421
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:02,611
These guys were robbing an atm

422
00:21:02,613 --> 00:21:05,180
- with high-tech weapons...
- Take a breath. I don't have time

423
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:07,182
- for atm robberies...
<i>- yeah, but...</i>

424
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:08,850
Or the notes you leave behind.

425
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,485
I have moving day
to worry about.

426
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:11,987
<i>Everything's gotta be out
by next week.</i>

427
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:14,323
Wait, wait. You're moving?
Who's moving?

428
00:21:14,325 --> 00:21:15,958
Yeah, don't you watch the news?

429
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,726
Tony sold avengers tower.

430
00:21:17,728 --> 00:21:19,594
We're relocating
to a new facility upstate

431
00:21:19,596 --> 00:21:21,897
where hopefully the cell
service is much worse.

432
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:24,066
- But what about me?
- What about you?

433
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:28,270
Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me
or something big goes down?

434
00:21:28,272 --> 00:21:30,172
<i>Can I just please talk
to Mr. Stark?</i>

435
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:31,707
Just stay away
from anything dangerous.

436
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:34,744
I'm responsible for making sure
you're responsible, okay?

437
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:38,514
I am responsible.
I... oh, crap.

438
00:21:39,116 --> 00:21:41,349
<i>- My backpack's gone.</i>
- That doesn't sound responsible.

439
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:44,587
<i>- I'll call you back.</i>
- Feel free not to.

440
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:46,382
What was that?

441
00:22:46,984 --> 00:22:49,518
Uh, it's nothing. Nothing.

442
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,986
You're the Spider-man.

443
00:22:51,388 --> 00:22:53,755
- From YouTube.
- I'm not. I'm not.

444
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:53,788


445
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:56,958
- You were on the ceiling.
- No. Ned, what are you doing in my room?

446
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:56,972


447
00:22:56,974 --> 00:22:58,841
Aunt May let me in.
You say were gonna finish the death star.

448
00:22:58,842 --> 00:23:00,342
You can't just bust
into my room!

449
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:00,381


450
00:23:01,665 --> 00:23:03,732
That Turkey meatloaf recipe
is a disaster.

451
00:23:03,756 --> 00:23:03,776


452
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:07,102
Let's go to dinner.
Thai? Ned, you want thai?

453
00:23:07,104 --> 00:23:08,704
- Yes.
- No. He's got a thing.

454
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:11,207
A thing to do after.

455
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:13,209
Okay.

456
00:23:13,911 --> 00:23:15,779
Maybe put on some clothes.

457
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,114
Oh, she doesn't know?
Nobody knows.

458
00:23:19,616 --> 00:23:22,017
Mr. Stark knows because
he made my suit. That's it.

459
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:25,821
Tony Stark made you that?
Are you an avenger?

460
00:23:26,689 --> 00:23:27,823
Yeah, basically.

461
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:30,826
- Oh, geez.
- You can't tell anybody.

462
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:32,160
You gotta keep it a secret.

463
00:23:32,362 --> 00:23:33,996
- Secret? Why?
- You know what she's like.

464
00:23:33,998 --> 00:23:35,697
If she finds out people
try and kill me

465
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:37,699
every night,
she won't let me do this anymore.

466
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:39,067
Come on, Ned, please.

467
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:40,936
Okay, okay, okay.

468
00:23:40,938 --> 00:23:42,438
I'll level with you.

469
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,739
I don't thing can keep this as secret.

470
00:23:43,741 --> 00:23:45,374
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me, Peter.

471
00:23:45,376 --> 00:23:48,377
May cannot know.
I cannot do that to her right now.

472
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:50,345
You know?
I mean, everything

473
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:52,782
that's happened
with her, i... please.

474
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:57,653
- Okay.
- Just swear it, okay?

475
00:23:58,055 --> 00:23:59,221
I swear.

476
00:23:59,223 --> 00:24:01,023
- Thank you.
= Yeah.

477
00:24:01,225 --> 00:24:03,225
I can't believe
this is happening now.

478
00:24:03,227 --> 00:24:04,626
- Can I try the suit on?
- No.

479
00:24:04,628 --> 00:24:06,695
How's it work? Magnets?
How do you shoot the strings?

480
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:09,231
- I'm gonna tell you tomorrow.
- Great.

481
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:10,932
Okay, well, wait, then.

482
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:14,770
How do you do this
and the Stark internship?

483
00:24:15,772 --> 00:24:18,006
This is the Stark internship.

484
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:19,408
Ohh...

485
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,177
Just get out of here.

486
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:25,714
<i>What's the matter?</i>

487
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:28,116
Thought you loved larb.

488
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:30,252
It's too larby?

489
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:32,454
Not larby enough.

490
00:24:32,456 --> 00:24:36,158
How many times do I have
to say "larb" before...

491
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,926
You talk to me?

492
00:24:37,928 --> 00:24:39,461
You know I larb you.

493
00:24:39,463 --> 00:24:43,432
I'm just stressed.
The internship, and I'm tired.

494
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:44,566
A lot of work.

495
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:46,068
The Stark internship?

496
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,238
I have to tell you,
not a fan of that Tony Stark.

497
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,642
You're distracted all the time.
He's got you in your head.

498
00:24:54,944 --> 00:24:56,978
<i>...the beloved Queens institution,
Delmar Sandwiches was destroyed</i>

499
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,346
What does he have you doing?

500
00:24:58,348 --> 00:24:59,948
<i>in an explosion earlier tonight,</i>

501
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,117
<i>After an atm robbery
was thwarted</i>

502
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,953
<i>- by Queens own colorful local crime stopper,</i>
- what?

503
00:25:04,955 --> 00:25:05,921
<i>The spider-man.</i>

504
00:25:06,223 --> 00:25:08,457
<i>As the spider-man attempted
to foil their heist,</i>

505
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:10,092
<i>a powerful blast was set off,</i>

506
00:25:10,094 --> 00:25:12,627
<i>slicing through
the bodega across the street.</i>

507
00:25:12,629 --> 00:25:14,396
<i>Miraculously, no one was harmed.</i>

508
00:25:14,898 --> 00:25:16,865
If you spot something
like that happening,

509
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:18,734
you turn and you run
the other way.

510
00:25:19,136 --> 00:25:21,236
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course.

511
00:25:21,238 --> 00:25:22,771
Six blocks away from us.

512
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:26,407
- I need a new backpack.
- What?

513
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:28,210
I need a new backpack.

514
00:25:28,712 --> 00:25:30,179
That's five.

515
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:33,549
- Sticky rice pudding.
- We didn't order that.

516
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:35,384
It's on the house.

517
00:25:35,586 --> 00:25:37,820
Oh. Thanks.

518
00:25:39,222 --> 00:25:41,290
That's nice of him.

519
00:25:41,392 --> 00:25:43,993
I think he "larbs" you.

520
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:47,663
<i>You got bit by a spider?</i>

521
00:25:47,665 --> 00:25:48,697
Can it bite me?

522
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:50,465
Well, it probably
would've hurt, right?

523
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,468
Whatever. Even if it did hurt,
I'd let it bite me.

524
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,571
Maybe.
How much did it hurt?

525
00:25:55,573 --> 00:25:57,240
The spider's dead, Ned.

526
00:26:00,911 --> 00:26:02,011
Whoa.

527
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:07,827
You were here?

528
00:26:08,718 --> 00:26:10,386
Yeah.

529
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:13,055
You could've died.

530
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:17,459
Do you lay eggs?

531
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:19,595
What? No.

532
00:26:21,397 --> 00:26:24,132
- Can you spit venom?
- No.

533
00:26:24,634 --> 00:26:26,769
Can you summon
an army of spiders?

534
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:28,003
No, Ned.

535
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:30,939
<i>The Sokovia Accords
were put into place...</i>

536
00:26:31,141 --> 00:26:33,408
How far can you shoot your webs?

537
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,377
It's unknown. Shut up.

538
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:36,411
<i>To begin regulating...</i>

539
00:26:36,413 --> 00:26:38,980
If I was you,
i would stand on the edge of a building

540
00:26:38,982 --> 00:26:42,151
- and shoot as far as I could...
- Shut up, Ned.

541
00:26:42,753 --> 00:26:44,285
<i>Hi. I'm captain America.</i>

542
00:26:44,487 --> 00:26:46,555
<i>Whether you're in the classroom
or on the battlefield...</i>

543
00:26:46,557 --> 00:26:48,991
- Do you know him too?
- Yeah, we met.

544
00:26:49,393 --> 00:26:51,360
- I stole his shield.
- Woow...

545
00:26:51,362 --> 00:26:54,129
<i>Today, my good friend,
your gym teacher</i>

546
00:26:54,331 --> 00:26:57,365
<i>will be conducting the captain
America fitness challenge.</i>

547
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,400
Thank you, captain.

548
00:26:58,402 --> 00:27:01,936
Pretty sure he's a war criminal,
but what ever I have to show these videos.

549
00:27:01,938 --> 00:27:03,639
It's required by the state.
Let's do it.

550
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:05,974
Do avengers have to pay taxes?

551
00:27:05,976 --> 00:27:07,108
What does hulk smell like?

552
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,477
- I bet he smells nice.
- You have to shut up.

553
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:12,514
Is captain America cool, or is
he like a mean, old grandpa?

554
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:14,416
Ned, just shh, okay?

555
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:17,419
Hey, can I be your guy
in the chair?

556
00:27:17,421 --> 00:27:18,220
What?

557
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:20,956
Yeah. You know how there's a guy
with a headset

558
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:22,857
telling the other guy
where to go?

559
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:25,861
Like, If you're in a burning building,
i could tell you where to go.

560
00:27:25,863 --> 00:27:28,496
There'd be screens around me,
and I could swivel around.

561
00:27:28,498 --> 00:27:30,098
I could be your guy
in the chair.

562
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,167
Ned, I don't need
a guy in the chair.

563
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:33,903
Looking good, Parker.

564
00:27:35,771 --> 00:27:39,608
Now, see, for me,
it would be f Thor

565
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,576
marry iron man and kill hulk.

566
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,545
Well, what about
the spider-man?

567
00:27:43,547 --> 00:27:45,013
It's just spider-man.

568
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:47,215
See the bank security
cam on YouTube?

569
00:27:47,217 --> 00:27:48,250
He fought off four guys.

570
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:50,752
Oh, my gosh,
she's crushing on spider-man.

571
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:51,653
No way.

572
00:27:51,955 --> 00:27:54,256
- Kind of.
- Oh, gross.

573
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:55,957
He's probably, like, 30.

574
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:57,192
You don't know
what he looks like.

575
00:27:57,194 --> 00:27:58,693
What if he's seriously burned?

576
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:02,030
I wouldn't care. I would still love
him for the person he is inside.

577
00:28:02,032 --> 00:28:04,066
Peter knows spider-man.

578
00:28:06,735 --> 00:28:09,405
No, I don't.
No. I... I mean...

579
00:28:10,207 --> 00:28:11,306
They're friends.

580
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:13,943
Yeah, like coach Wilson
and captain America are friends.

581
00:28:14,645 --> 00:28:18,013
I've met him, yeah.
A couple times.

582
00:28:18,015 --> 00:28:19,214
But it's...

583
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:22,617
Through the Stark internship.

584
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:25,420
Yeah, well, I'm not really
supposed to talk about it.

585
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,889
Well, that's awesome.
Hey, you know what?

586
00:28:27,891 --> 00:28:30,258
Maybe you should invite him
to Liz's party. Right?

587
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,394
Yeah, um, I'm having
people over tonight.

588
00:28:32,396 --> 00:28:33,929
You're more
than welcome to come.

589
00:28:33,931 --> 00:28:36,064
- Having a party?
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.

590
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:39,401
You should totally invite
your personal friend spider-man.

591
00:28:39,403 --> 00:28:40,602
Um...
It's okay.

592
00:28:40,604 --> 00:28:44,039
I know Peter's way too busy
for parties anyway, so...

593
00:28:44,441 --> 00:28:46,441
Come on. He'll be there.
Right, Parker?

594
00:28:52,949 --> 00:28:54,216
What are you doing?

595
00:28:54,218 --> 00:28:55,451
Helping you out.

596
00:28:56,053 --> 00:28:57,619
Did you not hear her?

597
00:28:57,621 --> 00:28:59,788
Liz has a crush on you.

598
00:29:03,025 --> 00:29:04,192
Dude, you're an avenger.

599
00:29:04,694 --> 00:29:08,531
If any one of us has a chance
with a senior girl, it's you.

600
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,235
House party in the suburbs.

601
00:29:14,437 --> 00:29:17,639
Oh, I remember these.
Kind of jealous.

602
00:29:17,941 --> 00:29:20,408
- It'll be a night to remember.
- Oh...

603
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:23,478
Ned, some hats wear men.
You wear that hat.

604
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,081
- Yeah, it gives me confidence.
- Hm.

605
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:27,282
This is a mistake.

606
00:29:27,384 --> 00:29:28,784
Hey, let's just go home.

607
00:29:28,886 --> 00:29:29,985
Oh, Peter.

608
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:33,021
I know.
I know it's really hard

609
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:35,023
trying to fit in
with all the changes

610
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:36,591
your body's going through.

611
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:38,093
It's flowering now.

612
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:41,763
He's so stressed out lately.

613
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:43,732
What helps
with stress is a party.

614
00:29:43,734 --> 00:29:45,000
We should go to the party.

615
00:29:45,002 --> 00:29:47,702
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

616
00:29:48,437 --> 00:29:49,471
Peter...

617
00:29:50,273 --> 00:29:52,808
- Have fun, okay?
- I will.

618
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,443
Bye, may.

619
00:29:56,645 --> 00:29:58,046
Dude, you have the suit, right?

620
00:29:59,748 --> 00:30:01,949
This is gonna change our lives.

621
00:30:06,123 --> 00:30:08,156
<i>Annie, over here!</i>

622
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:09,758
<i>Hey.</i>

623
00:30:12,528 --> 00:30:14,796
<i>Dj Flash.</i>

624
00:30:15,198 --> 00:30:17,565
Okay. We're gonna have
spider-man swing in,

625
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:19,467
say you guys
are tight, and I get

626
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:21,403
a fist bump or one
of those half bro-hugs.

627
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:24,005
Can't believe you're
at this lame party.

628
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:26,342
But you're here too.

629
00:30:26,644 --> 00:30:28,110
Am I?

630
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:31,813
Oh, my gosh.

631
00:30:31,815 --> 00:30:34,182
Hey, guys.
Cool hat, Ned.

632
00:30:34,184 --> 00:30:35,784
- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, Liz.

633
00:30:35,986 --> 00:30:37,619
I'm so happy you guys came.

634
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:41,356
There's pizza and drinks.
Help yourself.

635
00:30:41,358 --> 00:30:43,792
- What a great party.
- Thanks.

636
00:30:46,396 --> 00:30:47,429
Oh...

637
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:50,666
My parents will kill me
if anything's broken. I gotta...

638
00:30:50,668 --> 00:30:52,367
- Yeah.
- Have fun.

639
00:30:52,569 --> 00:30:54,436
- Bye.
- Bye.

640
00:30:54,538 --> 00:30:56,538
Dude, what are you doing?

641
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,540
She's here.
Spider it up.

642
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:01,476
No, no, no. I can't...
I cannot do this.

643
00:31:01,478 --> 00:31:04,145
Spider-man is not
a party trick, okay?

644
00:31:04,247 --> 00:31:07,248
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.

645
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,651
Peter, no one wants that.

646
00:31:10,153 --> 00:31:11,453
Dude.

647
00:31:11,855 --> 00:31:14,722
Penis Parker, what's up?

648
00:31:14,924 --> 00:31:16,424
So where's your pal spider-man?

649
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:19,294
Let me guess,
In Canada with your imaginary girlfriend?

650
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:22,130
That's not spider-man.

651
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:26,601
That's just Ned in a red shirt.

652
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,175
"Hey, what's up?
I'm spider-man.

653
00:31:34,577 --> 00:31:37,445
"Just thought I'd swing by
and say hello to my buddy Peter.

654
00:31:37,847 --> 00:31:40,482
"Oh, what's up, Ned?
Hey, where's Peter, anyways?

655
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:42,284
He must be around..."

656
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:50,058
God, this is stupid.
What am I doing?

657
00:31:58,701 --> 00:32:00,135
What the hell?

658
00:32:07,876 --> 00:32:08,910
Uh!

659
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,891
This is sucks.

660
00:32:24,827 --> 00:32:26,227
Whoow!

661
00:32:27,931 --> 00:32:29,631
Now, this is crafted
from a reclaimed

662
00:32:29,633 --> 00:32:32,200
sub-ultron arm straight from Sokovia.

663
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:33,702
Here. You try.

664
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:36,837
Man, I wanted something low-key.

665
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:37,872
Why are you trying
to upsell me, man?

666
00:32:38,674 --> 00:32:40,708
Okay, okay.
I got what you need, all right?

667
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,878
I got tons of
great stuff here. One sec.

668
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,516
Okay, I got black hole grenades,
chitauri railguns...

669
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:50,952
You letting off shots in public now?
Hurry up.

670
00:32:51,154 --> 00:32:53,188
Look, times are changing.
We're the only ones

671
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,556
selling these
high-tech weapons.

672
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:58,293
Oh, this must be where
the atm robbers got their stuff.

673
00:32:58,295 --> 00:32:59,861
I just need something
to stakeout somebody.

674
00:32:59,863 --> 00:33:03,031
I'm not trying to shoot them
back in time.

675
00:33:03,033 --> 00:33:05,500
I got antigrav climbers.

676
00:33:05,502 --> 00:33:06,668
Yo, climbers?

677
00:33:08,938 --> 00:33:10,372
Okay, what the hell is that?

678
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:15,010
- Did you set us up?
- Hey, hey, man.

679
00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:20,149
Hey! Come on. You gonna shoot
at somebody, shoot at me.

680
00:33:20,951 --> 00:33:22,185
All right.

681
00:33:34,631 --> 00:33:36,499
What was that?

682
00:33:43,472 --> 00:33:44,741
What...?

683
00:33:47,876 --> 00:33:51,080
- We gotta call him.
- No, no, no, no.

684
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:57,919
Did you just do it again?

685
00:33:58,221 --> 00:34:00,888
- Shut up.
- I'm calling him.

686
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:10,498
Toomes's phone.

687
00:34:12,502 --> 00:34:13,969
Boss.

688
00:34:14,271 --> 00:34:15,704
Oh, my butt!

689
00:34:35,057 --> 00:34:37,693
Great. Guess I'm gonna have
to take a shortcut.

690
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:42,063
Hey, guys.
Good game. Have fun.

691
00:34:42,565 --> 00:34:44,699
Hey, hey, buddy.

692
00:34:45,201 --> 00:34:47,636
Sorry, no time to play.
Here, go fetch.

693
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:49,137
Whoo!

694
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:51,307
Now, this is more like it.

695
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,251
Whoa!

696
00:35:04,153 --> 00:35:05,587
Smells really good.

697
00:35:09,225 --> 00:35:10,492
Great movie!

698
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,333
Oh, hey, girls.

699
00:35:19,335 --> 00:35:20,601
No! No!

700
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:24,505
<i>Hey, it's Peter.
Leave a message.</i>

701
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:25,607
Peter, where are you?

702
00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:28,609
That's not working.
This is not cool.

703
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:31,913
Almost got you.

704
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,993
Thought you got away
from me, didn't you?

705
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:48,696
I got you
right where I want you.

706
00:35:48,698 --> 00:35:50,566
Surprise!

707
00:35:54,437 --> 00:35:55,671
What the hell?

708
00:36:42,885 --> 00:36:44,887
Oh, hey.

709
00:36:45,178 --> 00:36:46,178
Oh...

710
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:50,958
And then he just, like,
swooped down like a monster

711
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,127
and picked me up, and took me up

712
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:54,829
like a thousand feet
and just dropped me.

713
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:57,932
How'd you find me?
Did you put a tracker in my suit?

714
00:36:57,934 --> 00:37:00,635
I put everything in your suit.

715
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:02,270
Including this heater.

716
00:37:02,272 --> 00:37:04,439
Whoa.

717
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:08,676
- That's better. Thanks.
- What were you thinking?

718
00:37:08,678 --> 00:37:11,179
The guy with wings is
the source of the weapons.

719
00:37:11,181 --> 00:37:12,413
I gotta take him down.

720
00:37:12,415 --> 00:37:13,848
Take him down now, huh?

721
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:17,051
Steady, Crockett.
There are people who handle this sort of thing.

722
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:18,586
-The avengers?
- No, no, no.

723
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:19,987
This is a little below
their pay grade.

724
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:22,723
Anyway, Mr. Stark,
you didn't have to come out here.

725
00:37:22,725 --> 00:37:24,025
I had that. I was fine.

726
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:27,495
<i>Oh, I'm not here.</i>

727
00:37:27,897 --> 00:37:30,131
Thank god
this place has Wi-Fi

728
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:31,866
or you would be toast right now.

729
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:33,601
Thank Ganesh while you're at it.

730
00:37:33,603 --> 00:37:34,902
Cheers.

731
00:37:34,904 --> 00:37:37,772
<i>Look, forget the flying
vulture guy, please.</i>

732
00:37:37,774 --> 00:37:38,606
- Why?
<i>- Why?</i>

733
00:37:38,608 --> 00:37:40,475
Because I said so!

734
00:37:40,877 --> 00:37:44,279
Sorry, I'm talking
to a teenager.

735
00:37:44,281 --> 00:37:45,346
<i>Stay close to the ground.</i>

736
00:37:45,548 --> 00:37:47,748
<i>Build up your game helping
the little people,</i>

737
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,452
like that lady that
bought you the churro.

738
00:37:50,454 --> 00:37:53,621
Can't you just be a friendly

739
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:55,556
neighborhood spider-man?

740
00:37:55,558 --> 00:37:57,224
But I'm ready
for more than that now.

741
00:37:57,626 --> 00:37:59,560
<i>- No, you're not.</i>
- That is not what you thought

742
00:37:59,562 --> 00:38:01,829
- when I took on captain America.
<i>- Trust me, kid.</i>

743
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:03,965
<i>If cap wanted to lay you out,
he would've.</i>

744
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:05,966
<i>Listen to me.
If you come across</i>

745
00:38:05,968 --> 00:38:07,968
<i>these weapons again, call Happy.</i>

746
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,404
Are you driving?

747
00:38:10,806 --> 00:38:13,808
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about college.

748
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:16,945
I got some pull at MIT.
End call.

749
00:38:17,447 --> 00:38:18,613
No, I don't need to go to...

750
00:38:18,615 --> 00:38:21,650
<i>Mr. Stark is no longer connected.</i>

751
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:26,220
That's awesome.

752
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:32,026
"Stay close to the ground"?
What is he talking about?

753
00:38:42,304 --> 00:38:43,538
Whoa.

754
00:38:50,045 --> 00:38:52,113
Hey, man, what's up?
I'm on my way back.

755
00:38:52,115 --> 00:38:53,648
Actually, i was calling to say

756
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,116
maybe you shouldn't come.
Listen to this.

757
00:38:55,118 --> 00:38:57,985
When I say "penis,"
you say "Parker."

758
00:38:57,987 --> 00:38:59,186
- Penis!
- Parker!

759
00:38:59,188 --> 00:39:00,555
- Penis!
- Parker!

760
00:39:00,557 --> 00:39:03,291
<i>- Sorry, Peter.
- I guess we're still losers.</i>

761
00:39:03,293 --> 00:39:04,559
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

762
00:39:04,561 --> 00:39:07,562
I'll see you tomorrow in school.

763
00:39:32,888 --> 00:39:35,856
Whoa.

764
00:39:46,402 --> 00:39:47,936
Idiots.

765
00:39:48,938 --> 00:39:50,005
Idiots.

766
00:39:50,107 --> 00:39:51,306
Idiots!

767
00:39:52,108 --> 00:39:55,810
Boss? Your wife
keeps texting you.

768
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:57,144
Something about a brake light.

769
00:39:57,146 --> 00:39:59,313
What'd I tell you about
looking at my phone?

770
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:01,182
Oh. Sorry.
You left it out.

771
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:04,118
You know
I'm a curious person by nature.

772
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,623
I finished designing
that high-altitude vacuum seal.

773
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:10,124
- Huh?
- In case you want to,

774
00:40:10,126 --> 00:40:12,360
you know, go for the big one?

775
00:40:12,362 --> 00:40:15,062
You're still on that?
I told you, no.

776
00:40:15,064 --> 00:40:16,998
The answer's no.
Forget it.

777
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:23,738
Ha, ha, ha! Whoo!

778
00:40:28,243 --> 00:40:30,079
That was badass.

779
00:40:33,115 --> 00:40:35,082
How many times have I told you?

780
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:36,851
not to fire them
out in the open?

781
00:40:36,853 --> 00:40:40,021
- You said, move the merchandise.
- Under the radar.

782
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:41,222
Under the radar!

783
00:40:41,424 --> 00:40:43,157
That's how we survive.

784
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:44,759
If you bring DAMAGE CONTROL

785
00:40:44,761 --> 00:40:46,961
or The Avengers down here,
we're through.

786
00:40:46,963 --> 00:40:48,863
You're out there wearing
that goofy thing,

787
00:40:48,865 --> 00:40:51,966
lighting up cars
calling yourself the shocker.

788
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,901
"I'm the shocker.
I shock people."

789
00:40:53,903 --> 00:40:55,269
What is this, pro wrestling?

790
00:40:55,271 --> 00:40:58,205
Whatever, old man.
Come on.

791
00:40:58,674 --> 00:41:00,408
Look.

792
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,075
Look.

793
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:04,812
I know you don't give
a crap about anything.

794
00:41:04,814 --> 00:41:06,481
But I do.

795
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:07,715
I built this whole place

796
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:09,417
because I got people
i have to look after.

797
00:41:09,419 --> 00:41:14,021
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

798
00:41:15,357 --> 00:41:16,691
You know what?

799
00:41:16,693 --> 00:41:19,460
I can't afford your bullshit.

800
00:41:19,462 --> 00:41:21,128
- Get out of here.
- What?

801
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,963
You're done.
You're off the crew.

802
00:41:22,965 --> 00:41:25,299
Yeah, all right.

803
00:41:25,301 --> 00:41:26,267
Heh. All right.

804
00:41:26,269 --> 00:41:29,236
Wonder if you can afford me
out there, though, right?

805
00:41:29,238 --> 00:41:31,039
With everything I know.

806
00:41:31,941 --> 00:41:34,942
- Excuse me?
- I'm just saying,

807
00:41:34,944 --> 00:41:36,444
maybe your wife
would like to know

808
00:41:36,446 --> 00:41:39,780
where you really get
your money from.

809
00:41:39,782 --> 00:41:41,516
- You know what?
- What?

810
00:41:41,818 --> 00:41:42,917
You're right.

811
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:45,920
- That work?
- I don't know.

812
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:47,321
I can't afford that.

813
00:41:47,323 --> 00:41:49,357
W-w-wait.

814
00:41:56,565 --> 00:41:57,966
Damn.

815
00:42:00,668 --> 00:42:02,369
I thought this was
the anti-gravity gun.

816
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:05,440
What?
No, that's that one.

817
00:42:18,153 --> 00:42:19,954
Here.

818
00:42:20,055 --> 00:42:21,088
Now you're the shocker.

819
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:24,125
Go out there and find
that weapon he lost.

820
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:26,393
All right.

821
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:36,337
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.

822
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:38,806
Yeah, well, something came up.

823
00:42:38,808 --> 00:42:39,807
Oh, what is that?

824
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:43,210
I don't know. Some guy tried
to vaporize me with it.

825
00:42:43,212 --> 00:42:44,779
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

826
00:42:44,781 --> 00:42:45,546
Awesome.

827
00:42:45,948 --> 00:42:49,550
I mean, not awesome.
Totally uncool of that guy.

828
00:42:49,552 --> 00:42:52,019
-So scary.
- Yeah.

829
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:55,723
Well, look, I think
it's a power source.

830
00:42:55,725 --> 00:42:58,559
Yeah, but it's connected
to all these microprocessors.

831
00:42:58,561 --> 00:43:00,127
That's an inductive
charging plate.

832
00:43:00,129 --> 00:43:02,163
That's what I use
to charge my toothbrush.

833
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:03,430
Whoever's making these weapons

834
00:43:03,432 --> 00:43:05,032
is combining alien tech with ours.

835
00:43:05,234 --> 00:43:09,804
That is literally the coolest
sentence anyone has ever said.

836
00:43:09,806 --> 00:43:10,838
I just want to thank you

837
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,973
for letting me be
part of your journey

838
00:43:12,975 --> 00:43:15,210
into this amazing...

839
00:43:17,545 --> 00:43:21,816
Keep your fingers
clear of the blades.

840
00:43:22,317 --> 00:43:24,318
I gotta figure out what this is
and who makes it.

841
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,555
We'll go to the lab after class
and run some tests.

842
00:43:27,557 --> 00:43:29,357
Yeah.

843
00:43:36,432 --> 00:43:38,632
First, we put the glowy thing
in the mass spectrometer.

844
00:43:38,634 --> 00:43:41,436
First we gotta come up with a better
name than "glowy thingy."

845
00:43:41,438 --> 00:43:42,682
You're right.

846
00:43:43,973 --> 00:43:44,706
Crap.

847
00:43:45,408 --> 00:43:47,375
Come on, come on, come on.

848
00:43:51,813 --> 00:43:52,980
High schools creep me out.

849
00:43:53,982 --> 00:43:56,282
They got this funny smell,
you know what I mean?

850
00:43:56,284 --> 00:43:58,820
Hey, that's one of the guys
that tried to kill me.

851
00:43:58,822 --> 00:44:00,621
- What?
- Yeah.

852
00:44:00,623 --> 00:44:01,455
We gotta get out of here.

853
00:44:01,657 --> 00:44:03,690
No, no, no. I gotta follow them.

854
00:44:03,692 --> 00:44:05,860
They can lead me to the guy
that dropped me in the lake.

855
00:44:06,262 --> 00:44:09,130
- Someone dropped you in a lake?
- Yeah, it was not good.

856
00:44:10,498 --> 00:44:12,399
- Peter...
- No. Stay there, Ned.

857
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:14,635
Peter.

858
00:44:16,939 --> 00:44:18,473
What are you doing?

859
00:44:18,475 --> 00:44:19,674
Nothing.

860
00:44:19,676 --> 00:44:21,576
Yeah. You good?

861
00:44:22,378 --> 00:44:24,178
Chess.

862
00:44:24,479 --> 00:44:27,882
Man, can you imagine
what the boss would say

863
00:44:27,884 --> 00:44:29,149
if he knew where we were?

864
00:44:29,551 --> 00:44:31,485
It's saying there was
an energy pulse here.

865
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:33,220
There's no sign of the weapon.

866
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:35,990
And even if it was here,
now it's gone.

867
00:44:35,992 --> 00:44:38,593
So are we.

868
00:45:09,224 --> 00:45:12,126
This is so awesome.

869
00:45:12,128 --> 00:45:15,029
I know, right?

870
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:19,000
They're in Brooklyn.

871
00:45:23,171 --> 00:45:25,240
Staten island.

872
00:45:31,046 --> 00:45:33,014
Leaving Jersey.

873
00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:41,923
They stopped.

874
00:45:42,825 --> 00:45:43,825
Huh.

875
00:45:44,927 --> 00:45:46,026
Maryland?

876
00:45:46,028 --> 00:45:48,062
- What's there?
- I don't know.

877
00:45:48,564 --> 00:45:49,430
Evil lair?

878
00:45:49,432 --> 00:45:51,598
- They have a lair?
- Dude, a gang with alien guns

879
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,368
run by a guy with wings?
Yeah, they have a lair.

880
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:55,669
Badass.

881
00:45:55,671 --> 00:45:59,073
But how are you gonna get there
if it's, like, 300 miles away?

882
00:46:00,775 --> 00:46:03,978
It's not too far from D.C.

883
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,579
- Hey, it's Peter.
- Guys.

884
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:06,680
- Peter?
- Hey, buddy.

885
00:46:06,682 --> 00:46:08,749
Yeah, I was hoping I could
rejoin the team.

886
00:46:08,751 --> 00:46:10,617
No, no way.
You can't just quit on us,

887
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:13,354
stroll up and be
welcomed back by everyone.

888
00:46:13,356 --> 00:46:14,488
Hey, welcome back, Peter!

889
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,590
Flash, you're back
to first alternate.

890
00:46:16,592 --> 00:46:18,092
- What?
- He's taking your place.

891
00:46:18,094 --> 00:46:19,593
Excuse me, can we go already?

892
00:46:19,695 --> 00:46:21,295
I was hoping to get in
some light protesting

893
00:46:21,297 --> 00:46:23,563
in front of one
of the embassies before dinner, so...

894
00:46:23,765 --> 00:46:27,267
Protesting is patriotic.
Let's get on the bus.

895
00:46:28,135 --> 00:46:29,136
<i>Focus up, everyone.</i>

896
00:46:29,138 --> 00:46:31,405
<i>Our next topic
is the moons of saturn.</i>

897
00:46:31,807 --> 00:46:33,874
The second law of thermodynamics.

898
00:46:33,876 --> 00:46:36,076
- Frank Sinatra.
- Fort sumter.

899
00:46:36,078 --> 00:46:38,212
- Flash is wrong.
- Okay, guys, let's focus.

900
00:46:38,214 --> 00:46:40,114
-Next one.
- Liz, don't overwork 'em.

901
00:46:40,416 --> 00:46:42,416
Uh, strontium, barium,
vibranium.

902
00:46:42,418 --> 00:46:44,752
Very good, Peter.
Glad to have you back.

903
00:46:45,054 --> 00:46:47,087
Glad to be back.

904
00:46:47,289 --> 00:46:48,722
What is the current
standard unit of...?

905
00:46:49,124 --> 00:46:50,558
Can I take this real quick?
I'll only be a sec.

906
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,826
- Yeah, fine.
- Hello?

907
00:46:52,828 --> 00:46:55,062
Got a blip on my screen here.
You left New York?

908
00:46:55,064 --> 00:46:56,630
<i>- Okay, focus up, everyone.</i>
- Tracker.

909
00:46:56,632 --> 00:46:59,333
Yeah, no, it's just a school trip.
It's nothing.

910
00:46:59,335 --> 00:47:00,667
Look, happy, I gotta say,

911
00:47:00,669 --> 00:47:02,202
you tracking me
without my permission

912
00:47:02,204 --> 00:47:04,271
is a complete violation
of my privacy.

913
00:47:04,473 --> 00:47:06,106
- That's different.
- What's different?

914
00:47:06,108 --> 00:47:08,776
Nothing. Look, it's just
the academic decathlon.

915
00:47:08,778 --> 00:47:10,210
<i>- It's no big deal.</i>
- Hey, hey.

916
00:47:10,212 --> 00:47:13,180
I'll decide if it's no big deal.

917
00:47:13,648 --> 00:47:15,282
Sounds like it's no big deal,

918
00:47:15,284 --> 00:47:17,284
but remember, I'm watching you.

919
00:47:28,195 --> 00:47:30,731
- Everyone stick together.
- Yeah.

920
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:33,100
You kidding me?
This place is huge.

921
00:47:33,102 --> 00:47:35,636
- I've seen bigger.
- There's a bird in here.

922
00:47:35,638 --> 00:47:38,639
Hey, you brought
your laptop, right?

923
00:47:38,641 --> 00:47:40,374
Why?

924
00:47:47,716 --> 00:47:48,515
Peter,

925
00:47:48,517 --> 00:47:51,852
why are we removing
the tracker from your suit?

926
00:47:51,854 --> 00:47:54,288
Uh, because
i gotta follow these guys

927
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,090
to their boss
before they move again

928
00:47:56,092 --> 00:47:59,660
and I don't really want
Mr. Stark to know about it.

929
00:47:59,662 --> 00:48:01,696
So you're lying to iron man now?

930
00:48:01,698 --> 00:48:03,163
No, I'm not lying.

931
00:48:03,165 --> 00:48:07,167
He just doesn't really get
what I can do yet.

932
00:48:11,106 --> 00:48:11,872
Oh, gotcha.

933
00:48:12,174 --> 00:48:17,678
All right, Happy,
enjoy tracking this lamp.

934
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:22,516
There's a ton
of other subsystems in here.

935
00:48:22,518 --> 00:48:23,217
Hmm?

936
00:48:23,219 --> 00:48:27,221
But they're all disabled
by the training wheels protocol.

937
00:48:27,223 --> 00:48:27,754
What?

938
00:48:27,756 --> 00:48:30,724
"Training wheels protocol"?

939
00:48:30,726 --> 00:48:31,625
Turn it off.

940
00:48:31,627 --> 00:48:33,527
I don't think that's a good idea.

941
00:48:33,529 --> 00:48:34,895
They're blocked for a reason.

942
00:48:34,897 --> 00:48:37,131
Come on, man,
i don't need training wheels.

943
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:39,733
I'm sick of him treating me
like a kid all the time.

944
00:48:39,735 --> 00:48:42,035
- It's not cool.
- But you are a kid.

945
00:48:42,037 --> 00:48:44,338
Yeah, a kid who can stop
a bus with his bare hands.

946
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,540
Peter, I just don't think
this is a great idea.

947
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:48,909
I mean, what if this is illegal?

948
00:48:48,911 --> 00:48:49,843
Look, please.

949
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:51,678
This is my chance
to prove myself.

950
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,380
I can handle it.
Ned, come on.

951
00:48:53,382 --> 00:48:55,582
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

952
00:48:55,584 --> 00:48:56,717
The guy in the chair.

953
00:48:56,719 --> 00:48:59,753
- Don't do that.
- Come on.

954
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,770
The glowy thing, it's evidence.
Keep it safe, all right?

955
00:49:15,772 --> 00:49:17,638
Okay. Okay.

956
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,208
- They're moving.
- Be careful.

957
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:25,946
- Hey, Liz.
- Perfect timing.

958
00:49:26,348 --> 00:49:27,414
We're gonna go swimming.

959
00:49:27,416 --> 00:49:29,316
- Come on, come on.
- What?

960
00:49:29,818 --> 00:49:32,653
- Hey, Peter.
- Hi.

961
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:34,054
Hey.

962
00:49:34,956 --> 00:49:38,859
I was... I was gonna go study
in the business center.

963
00:49:39,161 --> 00:49:40,327
Peter, you don't need to study.

964
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:41,962
You're, like, the smartest guy
I've ever met.

965
00:49:41,964 --> 00:49:44,698
And besides,
a rebellious group activity

966
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,734
the day before competition
is good for morale.

967
00:49:47,736 --> 00:49:48,502
Hm?

968
00:49:48,504 --> 00:49:50,671
Well, I read that
in a Ted talk, so...

969
00:49:50,673 --> 00:49:53,340
I...
I heard it in Ted talk.

970
00:49:53,342 --> 00:49:54,775
And I read a coaching book.

971
00:49:55,677 --> 00:49:58,745
Are you really...
This is really important to you.

972
00:49:58,747 --> 00:50:00,714
Yeah. It's our future.

973
00:50:00,716 --> 00:50:02,816
I'm not gonna screw it up.

974
00:50:02,818 --> 00:50:04,518
Besides, we raided the minibar

975
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,653
and these candy bars were,
like, $11.

976
00:50:06,655 --> 00:50:09,823
So get your trunks on
and come on.

977
00:50:09,825 --> 00:50:10,657
Come on.

978
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:12,926
- Come on.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

979
00:50:12,928 --> 00:50:14,228
Let's go.

00:50:49,031 --> 00:50:52,699
I put a tracker on someone.
He's a bad guy.

00:51:21,797 --> 00:51:24,398
in a gas station?
That's so lame.

998
00:51:27,968 --> 00:51:29,569
Hey, suit lady,
what are they doing?

1007

Whoa, they're in the middle
of a heist.

1008
00:51:48,724 --> 00:51:51,358
I could catch 'em all
red-handed. This is awesome.

1009
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,793
Okay, I'm gonna get a little closer

1010
00:51:52,795 --> 00:51:54,128

You two wait right here.

1026
00:52:30,866 --> 00:52:32,899
Wait. You're gonna want
to turn on the dampers

1027
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:34,768
or that thing will
shatter your arm.

1028

No, the other...

00:55:46,094 --> 00:55:48,595
The Liz.
No, no, no.

1080
00:55:48,597 --> 00:55:50,831
God, that's...
That's weird.

1081
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:52,733
What about Karen?

1082
00:55:53,735 --> 00:55:55,568
<font color="#ff8000"><i>You can call me Karen
if you would like.</i></font>

1083
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:59,339
Hey, Karen, what else
can this suit do?

1084
00:55:59,641 --> 00:56:00,640
What?

1085
00:56:00,642 --> 00:56:03,009
Maybe we should run
that refresher course.

1090
00:56:14,254 --> 00:56:17,090
Should I tell Liz
that I'm spider-man?

1091

<font color="#ff8000"><i>Who is Liz?</i></font>

1092

She's... heh.

1093
00:56:21,029 --> 00:56:22,729
She's the best.
She's awesome.

1094
00:56:22,731 --> 00:56:25,665
She's just a girl
who goes to my school.

1095
00:56:25,667 --> 00:56:26,700
And, uh...

1096
00:56:26,702 --> 00:56:28,835
Yeah, I just...
I really want to tell her,

1097
00:56:29,137 --> 00:56:31,004
but it's kind of weird,
you know?

1098
00:56:31,006 --> 00:56:34,040
"Hey, I'm... I'm spider-man."

<font color="#ff8000"><i>What's weird about that?</i></font>

1100
00:56:35,177 --> 00:56:37,210
What if she's expecting
someone like Tony Stark?

1101
00:56:37,212 --> 00:56:40,046
Imagine how disappointed
she'd be when she sees me.

1102
00:56:40,048 --> 00:56:41,348
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Well, if I were her,</i></font>

1105
00:56:44,987 --> 00:56:47,287
It's really nice
to have somebody to talk to.

1106
00:56:47,689 --> 00:56:49,990
Hey, how long
we been here anyways?

<font color="#ff8000"><i>- Thirty-seven minutes.</i></font>
- What?

1108
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,160
Thirty-seven minutes?
That's insane.

1109
00:56:54,162 --> 00:56:55,328
I cannot take this anymore.

1110
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:58,164
I got to...
I gotta get out of here.

1111
00:56:59,366 --> 00:57:02,402
There's got to be something
in here I can use.

1112
00:57:03,204 --> 00:57:05,405
Okay, let's see.

Nope.

1115
00:57:09,644 --> 00:57:11,677
Ah. Hey, it's like the glowy thing.

<font color="#ff8000"><i>That glowy thing is an

carrying around a bomb?

<font color="#ff8000"><i>It would require radiation

1120
00:57:21,823 --> 00:57:24,057
No, no, no, no, no.

1121
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:31,364
Hey! Please! Please, somebody,
let me out! Hey!

1122
00:57:31,366 --> 00:57:33,833
Karen, you have to help me
override that time lock.

1123
00:57:33,835 --> 00:57:36,270
Okay, Karen,
lower the voltage and run it.

have to try every sequence.

1126
00:57:43,078 --> 00:57:46,379
Ned, Peter, we're gonna
be late. Come on, let's go.

1127
00:57:46,381 --> 00:57:50,116
Okay. Hold on, hold on.

Please be sure
all cell phones are turned off.

1131
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:14,708
Thank you.

1132
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:17,143
Karen, get me to the decathlon

the Washington monument.

<i>It's ned. Leave a message.</i>

1136

Ned, call me back!
The glowy thing's a bomb!

1137
00:58:28,623 --> 00:58:30,490
<i>There's a vehicle approaching
on your right.</i>

1138
00:58:30,892 --> 00:58:33,259
We have now entered
sudden death.

1139
00:58:33,261 --> 00:58:36,264
The next correct answer
wins the championship.

1140
00:58:40,769 --> 00:58:42,936
Midtown tech?

1141
00:58:42,938 --> 00:58:44,037
Zero.

1142
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:45,738
That is correct.

1143

<i>Midtown takes the championship!</i>

1144
00:58:48,744 --> 00:58:51,044

1145
00:58:51,046 --> 00:58:52,479
You guys, i am so proud of you.

1146
00:58:52,481 --> 00:58:53,914
Told you we didn't need Peter.

1147
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:56,049
Flash, you didn't answer single question.

1148
00:58:56,051 --> 00:58:57,951
- Taking it all in, Michelle?
- Oh, yeah, I just...

1149
00:58:57,953 --> 00:59:00,620
Um, I don't want
to celebrate something

1150
00:59:00,622 --> 00:59:01,688
that was built by slaves.

1151
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:06,359
I'm sure the Washington monument
wasn't built by...

1152
00:59:07,495 --> 00:59:08,495
Okay.

1153

- Enjoy your book.
- Thanks.

1154

- Oh, Ned, you're alive!
- Peter, are you okay?

1155
00:59:15,971 --> 00:59:17,470
Where's the glowy thing?
The glowy thing?

1156
00:59:17,472 --> 00:59:19,506
Don't worry, it's safe.
It's in my backpack.

1157
00:59:19,508 --> 00:59:21,407
Ned, listen!
The glowy thing is dangerous!

1158
00:59:21,409 --> 00:59:23,076
You missed the decathlon.
I covered for you.

1159
00:59:23,078 --> 00:59:25,512
Ned, listen to me!
We're at the Washington mon...

1160
00:59:25,514 --> 00:59:26,980

1164
00:59:31,987 --> 00:59:33,887
I want to be mad,
but I'm more worried.

1165
00:59:33,889 --> 00:59:35,321
Like, what is going on with you?

1166
00:59:35,323 --> 00:59:37,090
I have to talk to ned.
It's important!

1167
00:59:37,092 --> 00:59:38,458
Miss, all items
on the belt, please.

1168

Liz? Liz! Damn it.

1171
00:59:50,204 --> 00:59:53,240
Mr. Harrington, can I be the one
to tell Peter he's expelled?

1172
00:59:57,044 --> 01:00:00,413
The Washington monument

five and one-eighth inches tall.

1174

are cut around the stone.

1176

1177
01:00:15,063 --> 01:00:16,930
No, no, no.

1224
01:02:53,621 --> 01:02:55,855
- Come on.
- Don't worry about the trophy.

1225
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:59,294
Ahh!

1226
01:03:03,731 --> 01:03:04,998
<i>Stand down!</i>

1227
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:08,135
<i>Return to the ground
immediately!</i>

1228
01:03:11,471 --> 01:03:14,741
<i>Return to the ground
or we will open fire!</i>

1229
01:03:14,743 --> 01:03:16,642
Go up, go up.

1230
01:03:17,144 --> 01:03:18,278
I got this.

1231
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,313
Take my trophy!

1232
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:24,084
<i>This is your last chance!</i>

1233
01:03:24,486 --> 01:03:26,320
Oh, I'm gonna die.

1234
01:03:27,122 --> 01:03:30,023
Look out!

1235
01:03:35,062 --> 01:03:36,331
Breeaaaak!!

1236
01:03:50,444 --> 01:03:52,279
I did it! Whoa!

1237
01:04:05,124 --> 01:04:06,559
Ahmm. Hey, how you doing?

1238
01:04:06,561 --> 01:04:08,327
Don't worry about it.
I got you.

1239
01:04:08,329 --> 01:04:10,196
- Yes! Yes!
- Hey, hey, hey.

1240
01:04:10,898 --> 01:04:13,033
- Big guy, quit moving around.
- I'm sorry, sir. So sorry.

1241
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:19,271
Let's go, let's go!

1242
01:04:22,744 --> 01:04:24,410
Okay, okay.

1243
01:04:24,412 --> 01:04:26,345
Mr. Harrington, go.
Ned, come on.

1244
01:04:26,547 --> 01:04:28,948
- All right, this is your stop.
- Come on, Liz.

1245
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:30,683
Go, go, go.
Everybody out!

1246
01:04:30,685 --> 01:04:32,218
Move it, people.
Move it, move it!

1247
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,388
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Liz!

1248
01:04:39,726 --> 01:04:41,594
You're okay. You're okay.

1249
01:04:44,832 --> 01:04:46,099
Okay.

1250
01:04:46,501 --> 01:04:48,034
- Oh, my god.
- Good, come on.

1251
01:04:48,036 --> 01:04:50,169
- Come on up.
- Come on, you guys, stay back.

1252
01:04:50,171 --> 01:04:52,305
- Come on in.
- You guys good?

1253
01:04:52,607 --> 01:04:54,841
So is everyone okay?

Thank you.

1258
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:10,324
Are you really friends
with Peter Parker?

1259
01:05:17,064 --> 01:05:18,598
I can finish the next order,

1260
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:22,035
but without any new materials
from that truck...

1261
01:05:22,537 --> 01:05:24,637
Yeah, damn it.

1262
01:05:25,139 --> 01:05:27,673
We still have enough to do
the Gargan deal though, right?

1263
01:05:27,675 --> 01:05:29,810
Yeah, but then that's it.

1264
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:35,648
Oh, maybe it is time that
i built the high-altitude seal.

1265
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:37,884
- Would you shut up about that?
- It's only one job.

1266
01:05:37,886 --> 01:05:39,320
No.

1267
01:05:41,022 --> 01:05:43,055
Eight years,
not a word from the feds,

1268

nothing from those
Halloween-costume-wearing bozos

1269
01:05:46,361 --> 01:05:48,361
up there in Stark tower.

1270
01:05:48,363 --> 01:05:49,662
And then all of a sudden,

1271
01:05:49,664 --> 01:05:52,598
this little bastard
in red tights shows up

1272
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:57,138
and he thinks he can tear down
everything I've built.

1273
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:01,240
Really?

1274
01:06:01,342 --> 01:06:02,608
I'm gonna kill him.

1275
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:04,210
- I'm gonna find him...
- I found him.

<i>Explosion. Sally scream.

1287

your spider spirit?</i>

1298
01:07:03,169 --> 01:07:04,670
Dude, dude, dude, dude.

1299
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:08,274
What is it like being famous
when nobody knows it's you?

1300
01:07:08,276 --> 01:07:09,775
- Crazy, dude.
- It's crazy.

1301
01:07:09,777 --> 01:07:11,911
- Should we tell everyone?
- No.

1302
01:07:11,913 --> 01:07:13,012
Should I tell someone?

1303
01:07:13,214 --> 01:07:14,714
No, dude.
That's not a good idea.

1304
01:07:15,016 --> 01:07:16,382
Okay, come on,
we'll be late to class.

1305
01:07:16,784 --> 01:07:19,084
- I'm not going to class.
- You're already in so much trouble

1306
01:07:19,086 --> 01:07:21,587
- for ditching the decathlon.
- Dude, listen, I figured it out.

1307
01:07:21,589 --> 01:07:23,823
The wingsuit guy is stealing
from DAMAGE CONTROL.

1308
01:07:23,825 --> 01:07:25,691
What he takes
from DAMAGE CONTROL,

1309
01:07:25,693 --> 01:07:27,226
that's how he builds the weapons.

1310
01:07:27,228 --> 01:07:28,527
So all I gotta do is catch him.

1311
01:07:28,529 --> 01:07:29,829
But we have a Spanish quiz.

1312
01:07:30,231 --> 01:07:32,265
Ned, I'm probably never
gonna come back here.

1313
01:07:32,267 --> 01:07:34,500
Mr. Stark is moving
the avengers upstate

1314
01:07:34,502 --> 01:07:37,703
- so... when I bring this guy in...
- Dude.

1315
01:07:38,105 --> 01:07:39,972
You want to be
a high school dropout?

1316
01:07:40,174 --> 01:07:43,076
I am so far beyond
high school right now.

1317
01:07:43,078 --> 01:07:46,546
Parker, my office.

1318

<i>So...</i>

1319
01:07:49,984 --> 01:07:51,050
<i>You got detention.</i>

1320
01:07:51,052 --> 01:07:53,986
<i>You screwed up. You know
what you did was wrong.</i>

1321
01:07:53,988 --> 01:07:56,455
<i>The question is, how are
you gonna make things right?</i>

1322
01:07:56,457 --> 01:07:57,957
<i>Maybe you were
trying to be cool.</i>

1323
01:07:57,959 --> 01:08:01,226
<i>But take it from a guy
who's been frozen for 65 years,</i>

1324
01:08:01,228 --> 01:08:04,363
<i>the only way to really be cool
is to follow the rules.</i>

1325
01:08:04,365 --> 01:08:07,466
<i>We all know what's right.
We all know what's wrong.</i>

1326
01:08:08,368 --> 01:08:10,536
<i>Next time those turkeys try
to convince you of something</i>

1327
01:08:10,538 --> 01:08:13,172
<i>- you know is wrong...</i>
- Where you going? Get back here.

1328

<i>...just think to yourself,
what would captain America do?</i>

1329
01:08:15,876 --> 01:08:18,110
Why are you here?
You don't even have detention.

1330
01:08:18,112 --> 01:08:20,079
Oh, I know.

01:08:23,617 --> 01:08:25,886
Heheh...
It's you.

1333
01:08:26,788 --> 01:08:28,153
<i>So your body's changing.</i>

1334

<i>Believe me,
I know how that feels.</i>

1335
01:08:42,402 --> 01:08:44,070
May?

1336
01:08:47,473 --> 01:08:48,540
Hey, Karen. What's up?

1337
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:50,343
<i>Hey, Peter.
How was your Spanish quiz?</i>

1338
01:08:50,345 --> 01:08:51,811
I was wondering
if you could help me.

1339
01:08:51,813 --> 01:08:53,179

but, i mean...

1341
01:08:54,816 --> 01:08:56,816

No, no, no.

01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,860
- All right, chill.
- Come on!

1373
01:10:15,562 --> 01:10:17,797
- What happened to your voice?
- What do you mean?

1374
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:20,666
I heard you by the bridge.
I know what a girl sound like.

1375
01:10:20,668 --> 01:10:22,067
I'm not a girl!
I'm a boy.

1376
01:10:22,069 --> 01:10:23,536
I mean,
I'm a... I'm a man.

1377
01:10:23,738 --> 01:10:25,704
I don't care what you are,
a boy, a girl...

1378
01:10:25,706 --> 01:10:27,706
I'm not a girl!
I'm a man.

1379
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:28,641
Come on, man.

1380
01:10:28,643 --> 01:10:29,975
Look, who is selling
these weapons?

1381
01:10:30,277 --> 01:10:32,779
I need to know.
Give me names or else.

1382
01:10:35,917 --> 01:10:37,650
You ain't ever
done this before, huh?

1383
01:10:37,852 --> 01:10:41,454
Deactivate interrogation mode.

1384
01:10:41,456 --> 01:10:42,988
Look, man,

1385
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:46,025
these guys are selling weapons
that are crazy dangerous.

1386
01:10:46,027 --> 01:10:47,626
They can't be out
on the streets.

1387
01:10:47,628 --> 01:10:50,195
If one of them can cut
Delmar's bodega in half...

1388
01:10:50,197 --> 01:10:52,731
- You know delmar's?
- Yeah, best sandwich in queens.

1389
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:55,100
- Sub haven's pretty good.
- It's too much bread.

1390
01:10:55,102 --> 01:10:58,671
- I like bread.
- Come on, man, please.

1391
01:10:59,405 --> 01:11:02,475
Stupid interrogation mode.
Karen, don't ever do that again.

1392
01:11:02,677 --> 01:11:04,043
The other night,
you told that dude,

1393
01:11:04,045 --> 01:11:06,679
"if you shoot somebody, shoot me."

1394
01:11:06,681 --> 01:11:07,946
It's pretty ballsy.

1395
01:11:07,948 --> 01:11:09,982
I don't want those weapons
in this neighborhood.

1396
01:11:09,984 --> 01:11:11,752
I got a nephew who live here.

1397
01:11:12,854 --> 01:11:13,886
Who are these guys?

1398
01:11:13,888 --> 01:11:15,854
What can you tell me
about the guy with the wings?

1399
01:11:15,956 --> 01:11:18,657
Other than he's a psychopath
dressed like a demon, nothing.

1400
01:11:18,659 --> 01:11:21,294
I don't know who he is
or where he is.

1401
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:26,999
- I do know where he's gonna be.
- Really?

1402
01:11:27,301 --> 01:11:29,568
Yeah, this crazy dude
i used to work with,

1403
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:32,271
he's supposed
to be doing a deal with him.

1404
01:11:32,273 --> 01:11:33,706
Yes! Yees...

1405
01:11:34,108 --> 01:11:35,241
- Thank...
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

1406
01:11:35,243 --> 01:11:37,810
I didn't tell you where.
You don't have a location.

1407
01:11:37,812 --> 01:11:40,880
Right, of course.
Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just...

1408
01:11:40,882 --> 01:11:41,681
Yeah.

1409
01:11:42,283 --> 01:11:44,683
- Where is it?
- Can I give you some advice?

1410
01:11:44,685 --> 01:11:45,585
Hmm?

1411
01:11:45,587 --> 01:11:47,822
You got to get better
at this part of the job.

1412
01:11:47,839 --> 01:11:49,506
I don't understand.

1413
01:11:49,524 --> 01:11:50,890
I'm intimidating.

1414
01:11:50,992 --> 01:11:53,792
- Staten island ferry, 11.
- Oh, that's soon.

1415
01:11:53,994 --> 01:11:55,995
Hey, that's gonna dissolve
in two hours.

1416
01:11:55,997 --> 01:11:58,630
No, no, no, no.
Come fix this.

1417
01:11:58,632 --> 01:12:00,533
- Two hours. You deserve that.
- I got ice cream in here.

1418
01:12:00,535 --> 01:12:03,402
You deserve that. You're a criminal.
Bye, Mr. criminal.

1419
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,985
Nice.

1420
01:12:22,321 --> 01:12:25,157
Okay, Karen, activate
"Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode".

<font color="#ff8000"><i>Sure thing.</i></font>

1422
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:28,928
<i>He's up front, main deck.</i>

1423
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:30,229
<i>I hate this guy.</i>

1424
01:12:30,231 --> 01:12:31,830
It's the guy
from the bridge, right?

1425
01:12:31,832 --> 01:12:33,899
- Who's that other guy?
<i>- Just keep me posted.</i>

1426

I'll call her back.

1430
01:12:42,876 --> 01:12:45,177
Hey, dronie,
keep an eye on that guy.

1431
01:12:45,179 --> 01:12:47,681
We can't let anybody
get away this time.

1432
01:12:55,421 --> 01:12:57,789
- Who's the guy on the left?
<font color="#ff8000"><i>- Mac Gargan.</i></font>

No, Karen, stop it
with the instant kill already.

1436
01:13:07,201 --> 01:13:09,203
White pickup truck.

1437
01:13:13,539 --> 01:13:16,409
Dronie, scan the ship
for a white pickup truck.

1438
01:13:36,962 --> 01:13:38,330
Oh, this is too perfect.

1439
01:13:38,332 --> 01:13:40,899
They got the weapons, buyers
and sellers in one place.

what is that?</i>

1449
01:14:02,923 --> 01:14:04,589
I'm at band practice.

1450

Noikk!

1455
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:19,572
Hey, guys. The illegal
weapons-deal ferry was at 10:30.

1456
01:14:19,574 --> 01:14:20,840
You missed it!

1457

Not so fast.

1460
01:14:36,891 --> 01:14:39,658
Are you guys okay?
 My bad. That was a little hard.

1461
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:43,229
I got to say, the other guy
was way better with that thing.

1462
01:14:44,331 --> 01:14:45,964
I'm honestly...

1463
01:14:45,966 --> 01:14:47,400
I'm... I'm shocked.

1464

So now what?

Mason, can you get

1522
01:20:54,168 --> 01:20:55,534
None of this would've happened

1523
01:20:55,536 --> 01:20:56,968
if you had just listened to me!

1524
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:00,306
If you even cared,
you'd actually be here.

1525
01:21:04,511 --> 01:21:05,610
I did listen, kid.

1526
01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:07,245
Who do you think
called the FBI, huh?

1527
01:21:07,647 --> 01:21:10,515
Do you know I was the only one
who believed in you?

1528
01:21:10,517 --> 01:21:12,417
Everyone else said I was crazy

1529
01:21:12,419 --> 01:21:15,020
- to recruit a 14-year-old kid.
- I'm 15.

1530
01:21:15,022 --> 01:21:16,689
No. This is where
you zip it, all right?

1531
01:21:16,691 --> 01:21:17,890
The adult is talking.

1532
01:21:17,992 --> 01:21:19,491
What if somebody
had died tonight?

1533
01:21:19,593 --> 01:21:22,695
Different story, right?
'Cause that's on you.

1534
01:21:22,697 --> 01:21:23,829
And if you died,

1535
01:21:24,431 --> 01:21:26,364
I feel like that's on me.

1536
01:21:27,066 --> 01:21:28,600
I don't need that
on my conscience.

1537
01:21:28,602 --> 01:21:29,968
- Yes, sir, I'm sorry.
- Yes.

1538
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:32,204
- Sorry doesn't cut it.
- I understand.

1539
01:21:32,406 --> 01:21:34,272
I just wanted to be like you.

1540
01:21:34,474 --> 01:21:36,275
And I wanted you to be better.

1541
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:38,844
Okay, it's not working out.

1542
01:21:38,846 --> 01:21:40,078
I'm gonna need the suit back.

1543
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,114
- For how long?
- Forever.

1544
01:21:42,516 --> 01:21:44,516
-Yeah, that's how it works.
- No, no. Please. Please.

1545
01:21:44,718 --> 01:21:45,884
- Let's have it.
- You don't understand.

1546
01:21:45,886 --> 01:21:48,253
This is all I have.
I'm nothing without this suit.

1547
01:21:48,855 --> 01:21:50,455
If you're nothing without this suit,

1548
01:21:50,457 --> 01:21:52,858
then you shouldn't have it, okay?

1549
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:55,060
God, I sound like my dad.

1550
01:21:56,996 --> 01:21:59,197
I don't have any other clothes.

1551
01:21:59,599 --> 01:22:01,433
Okay, we'll sort that out.

1552
01:22:11,911 --> 01:22:13,579
Hey.

1553
01:22:17,883 --> 01:22:19,618
I've been calling you all day.

1554
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:21,653
You didn't answer your phone.

1555
01:22:21,655 --> 01:22:22,854
You can't do that.

1556
01:22:22,856 --> 01:22:25,124
Then this ferry thing happens.

1557
01:22:25,726 --> 01:22:28,527
I've called five police
stations.

1558
01:22:28,729 --> 01:22:31,196
Five.
I called five of your friends.

1559
01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:33,265
- I called Ned's mother.
- I'm fine. May, I'm okay.

1560
01:22:33,267 --> 01:22:35,334
Honestly, just relax.
I'm fine.

1561
01:22:36,736 --> 01:22:39,337
Cut the bullshit.
I know you left detention.

1562
01:22:39,539 --> 01:22:41,840
I know you left the hotel
room in Washington.

1563
01:22:42,242 --> 01:22:44,476
I know you sneak out
of this house every night.

1564
01:22:44,678 --> 01:22:45,744
That's not fine.

1565
01:22:45,846 --> 01:22:47,879
Peter, you have to tell
me what's going on.

1566
01:22:48,281 --> 01:22:50,916
Just lay it out.
It's just me and you.

1567
01:22:52,518 --> 01:22:54,553
I lost the Stark internship.

1568
01:22:54,855 --> 01:22:56,888
- What?
- Yeah.

1569
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:58,122
What happened?

1570
01:22:58,324 --> 01:23:00,525
I just thought that
i could work really hard

1571
01:23:00,527 --> 01:23:02,528
and he could...
He would... you know.

1572
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:05,564
But...
I screwed it up.

1573
01:23:06,266 --> 01:23:08,334
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

1574
01:23:09,669 --> 01:23:11,670
It's okay.

1575
01:23:12,072 --> 01:23:14,306
I'm sorry i made you worry.

1576
01:23:14,608 --> 01:23:16,809
You know I'm not trying
to ruin your life.

1577
01:23:16,911 --> 01:23:18,143
Yeah, I know.

1578
01:23:18,145 --> 01:23:19,178
Just...

1579
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:23,215
- I used to sneak out too.
- Yeah.

1580
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:27,085
And take a shower.
You smell.

1581
01:23:27,687 --> 01:23:30,389
You smell like...
You smell like garbage.

1582
01:23:30,491 --> 01:23:32,291
I know.

1583
01:23:35,294 --> 01:23:37,262
<i>Peter, you're a good kid
and you're a smart kid,</i>

1584
01:23:37,264 --> 01:23:39,966
<i>so just try to keep
your head straight, okay?</i>

1585
01:23:40,868 --> 01:23:41,967
<i>Okay.</i>

1586
01:23:42,369 --> 01:23:44,037
All right, get out of here.

1587
01:23:52,211 --> 01:23:53,211
Are you expelled?

1588
01:23:53,213 --> 01:23:54,713
Do you have to go to
that school on 46th

1589
01:23:54,715 --> 01:23:56,481
where their principal has a crossbow?

1590
01:23:56,683 --> 01:23:57,949
Pretty sure that's an urban myth,

1591
01:23:57,951 --> 01:23:59,652
and, no, I'm not expelled.

1592
01:24:00,554 --> 01:24:02,187
You're so lucky.

1593
01:24:24,044 --> 01:24:26,279
<i>Muy bueno, seor Parker.</i>

1594
01:24:51,070 --> 01:24:52,137
Hey.

1595
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:53,405
Hey.

1596
01:24:53,407 --> 01:24:55,306
I thought you had
calculus fifth period.

1597
01:24:55,808 --> 01:24:58,243
Yeah, I was just doing
some homecoming stuff.

1598
01:24:58,445 --> 01:24:59,945
Hey, look, i...

1599
01:25:00,447 --> 01:25:01,946
I just wanted to apologize

1600
01:25:01,948 --> 01:25:03,816
about the whole decathlon thing.

1601
01:25:03,818 --> 01:25:04,916
- It's fine.
- really...

1602
01:25:05,118 --> 01:25:07,519
Last week, decathlon was
the most important thing,

1603
01:25:08,121 --> 01:25:09,387
but then i almost died.

1604
01:25:09,389 --> 01:25:11,423
No, I just...
I'm...

1605
01:25:11,425 --> 01:25:12,991
I just mean that

1606
01:25:13,793 --> 01:25:16,328
it was not cool, especially...

1607
01:25:18,397 --> 01:25:20,032
Because...

1608
01:25:21,367 --> 01:25:23,802
I like you.

1609
01:25:24,204 --> 01:25:25,671
I know.

1610
01:25:28,508 --> 01:25:29,574
You do?

1611
01:25:29,876 --> 01:25:32,477
You're terrible
at keeping secrets.

1612
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:34,746
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

1613
01:25:37,383 --> 01:25:39,884
I got to get to class, but i'm...

1614
01:25:40,086 --> 01:25:41,353
I'd say we should hang out,

1615
01:25:41,355 --> 01:25:43,655
but I'm gonna be in
detention for...

1616
01:25:43,657 --> 01:25:46,791
- Uh-huh.
- Ever, but...

1617
01:25:46,793 --> 01:25:49,861
I guess you already have a date
to homecoming.

1618
01:25:50,163 --> 01:25:51,796
Actually,
I was so busy planning it,

1619
01:25:51,798 --> 01:25:55,268
I never really got around
to that part, so...

1620
01:25:55,970 --> 01:25:57,536
Uh, you want...

1621
01:25:57,938 --> 01:25:59,538
go with me?

1622
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,706
Yeah. Sure.

1623
01:26:01,708 --> 01:26:04,743
Really?
I mean, great. Cool.

1624
01:26:04,945 --> 01:26:05,978
Cool.

1625
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,415
I'm actually going that way.

1626
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,995
May, I need your help.

1627
01:26:45,952 --> 01:26:47,051
<i>Right?</i>

1628
01:26:57,463 --> 01:26:59,664
It's game day.
So what's the plan?

1629
01:26:59,666 --> 01:27:00,999
- Open the door for her.
- Mm-hm.

1630
01:27:01,401 --> 01:27:03,067
Tell her she looks nice,
but not too much

1631
01:27:03,069 --> 01:27:05,003
- because that's creepy.
- Don't be creepy.

1632
01:27:05,005 --> 01:27:06,538
No.
And when I dance with her,

1633
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:09,674
I'm put my hands on her hips.
 I got this.

1634
01:27:12,412 --> 01:27:13,511
- Love you.
- Bye.

1635
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:30,228
You must be Peter.

1636
01:27:30,730 --> 01:27:32,130
Yeah.

1637
01:27:32,132 --> 01:27:33,598
I'm Liz's dad.

1638
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:35,134
Put 'er there.

1639
01:27:35,836 --> 01:27:37,280
Hell of a grip.

1640
01:27:37,471 --> 01:27:39,638
Come on in here.
Come on.

1641
01:28:03,362 --> 01:28:04,563
Hi, Peter.

1642
01:28:05,165 --> 01:28:06,931
You look very handsome.

1643
01:28:07,033 --> 01:28:08,132
Thank you.

1644
01:28:08,934 --> 01:28:10,802
You got his name right?

1645
01:28:11,104 --> 01:28:12,604
- Freddie?
- Peter.

1646
01:28:12,606 --> 01:28:14,672
Peter. Peter.

1647
01:28:14,774 --> 01:28:16,308
I'm gonna go get Liz.

1648
01:28:16,410 --> 01:28:17,810
Okay.

1649
01:28:23,849 --> 01:28:25,350
You all right, Pete?

1650
01:28:25,352 --> 01:28:26,284
Yeah.

1651
01:28:26,686 --> 01:28:30,088
Because you look... pale.

1652
01:28:31,156 --> 01:28:32,324
You want something to drink?

1653
01:28:32,326 --> 01:28:33,258
Like a bourbon

1654
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:34,893
or a scotch,
or something like that?

1655
01:28:35,095 --> 01:28:36,561
I'm not old enough to drink.

1656
01:28:36,863 --> 01:28:38,530
That's the right answer.

1657
01:28:40,267 --> 01:28:42,667
Wow!
Wow, wow, wow,

1658
01:28:42,669 --> 01:28:43,735
do you look beautiful.

1659
01:28:43,737 --> 01:28:45,470
Please don't embarrass me, dad.

1660
01:28:45,472 --> 01:28:46,671
Doesn't she, Pete?

1661
01:28:47,073 --> 01:28:49,040
Yeah, you look really good.

1662
01:28:49,842 --> 01:28:51,977
Once again,
that's the right answer.

1663
01:28:51,979 --> 01:28:53,979
Is that a corsage?

1664
01:28:55,981 --> 01:28:57,048
Thanks.

1665
01:28:57,550 --> 01:28:58,917
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur,

1666
01:28:58,919 --> 01:29:00,852
so let's get this
show on the road.

1667
01:29:01,054 --> 01:29:03,053
No, no, no, we have to take
some pictures, babe.

1668
01:29:03,055 --> 01:29:04,022
All right.

1669
01:29:04,024 --> 01:29:06,524
- Oh, right here. Perfect.
- Mom.

1670
01:29:06,526 --> 01:29:08,493
Okay. Come on,
you guys.

1671
01:29:08,895 --> 01:29:10,663
Peter, closer.

1672
01:29:12,231 --> 01:29:13,698
Smile.

1673
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,435
There you go.

1674
01:29:16,937 --> 01:29:18,003
Oh.

1675
01:29:22,007 --> 01:29:23,341
Sir, you don't have to drive us.

1676
01:29:23,343 --> 01:29:24,943
Nah, nah, it's not a big deal.

1677
01:29:25,345 --> 01:29:27,745
I'm going out of town.
It's right on my way.

1678
01:29:27,747 --> 01:29:28,913
He's always coming and going.

1679
01:29:28,915 --> 01:29:29,915
- Last time.
- Have fun.

1680
01:29:29,917 --> 01:29:31,183
- Thank you.
- Promise.

1681
01:29:31,385 --> 01:29:33,185
- He's cute.
- Shhhh...

1682
01:29:34,687 --> 01:29:35,854
- See you in a couple of days.
- Okay.

1683
01:29:35,856 --> 01:29:36,922
All right.

1684
01:29:37,724 --> 01:29:38,923
Come on, Pedro.

1685
01:29:39,525 --> 01:29:41,359
- Bye, Peter. Have fun.
- Yeah, I will.

1686
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:53,305
What are you gonna do, Pete?

1687
01:29:53,607 --> 01:29:54,305
What?

1688
01:29:54,707 --> 01:29:56,741
When you graduate,
what do you think you gonna do?

1689
01:29:56,843 --> 01:29:59,544
- Oh, I don't know.
- Don't grill him, dad.

1690
01:30:00,146 --> 01:30:01,980
Just saying, you know.

1691
01:30:02,382 --> 01:30:04,148
All you guys
who go to that school

1692
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:06,718
you pretty much have your
life planned out, right?

1693
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,953
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.

1694
01:30:09,555 --> 01:30:11,356
Peter has an internship
with Tony Stark.

1695
01:30:11,558 --> 01:30:13,391
So, I think he doesn't
have to worry.

1696
01:30:13,793 --> 01:30:14,959
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

1697
01:30:14,961 --> 01:30:17,095
- Stark?
- So cool.

1698
01:30:17,297 --> 01:30:19,297
Oh. What do you do?

1699
01:30:20,199 --> 01:30:23,001
Actually, I don't
intern for him anymore.

1700
01:30:23,103 --> 01:30:25,870
- Seriously?
- Yeah, it got um...

1701
01:30:26,172 --> 01:30:27,439
Boring.

1702
01:30:27,441 --> 01:30:28,473
It was boring?

1703
01:30:28,775 --> 01:30:30,408
You got to hang out
with spider-man.

1704
01:30:30,610 --> 01:30:32,510
Really?
Spider-man?

1705
01:30:33,112 --> 01:30:35,647
Wow.
What's he like?

1706
01:30:36,549 --> 01:30:38,249
Yeah, he's nice.

1707
01:30:38,251 --> 01:30:41,753
Nice man. Solid dude.

1708
01:30:42,756 --> 01:30:43,823
Hm.

1709
01:30:45,225 --> 01:30:47,158
Look. So cute.

1710
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:48,594
Oh...

1711
01:30:52,497 --> 01:30:54,265
I've seen you around, right?

1712
01:30:54,267 --> 01:30:56,033
I mean, somewhere.

1713
01:30:56,035 --> 01:30:58,870
We've... have we ever...?
Because even the voice...

1714
01:30:58,872 --> 01:31:01,105
Um...
He does academic decathlon with me.

1715
01:31:01,307 --> 01:31:02,840
- Oh.
- And he was at my party.

1716
01:31:02,942 --> 01:31:05,176
- Ah.
- It was a great party.

1717
01:31:05,178 --> 01:31:06,344
Really great, yeah.

1718
01:31:06,346 --> 01:31:08,246
Beautiful house,
a lot of windows.

1719
01:31:08,648 --> 01:31:10,682
You were there for,
like, two seconds.

1720
01:31:11,184 --> 01:31:11,916
That was...

1721
01:31:11,918 --> 01:31:13,885
I was there longer
than two seconds.

1722
01:31:14,587 --> 01:31:16,287
- You disappeared.
- No.

1723
01:31:16,289 --> 01:31:18,890
- No, I did not disappear.
- Yes, you did.

1724
01:31:18,892 --> 01:31:20,458
You disappeared
like you always do.

1725
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:22,293
Like you did in D.C. too.

1726
01:31:29,534 --> 01:31:30,702
That's terrible

1727
01:31:30,704 --> 01:31:33,705
what happened down
there in D.C. though...

1728
01:31:33,707 --> 01:31:35,240
Were you scared?

1729
01:31:35,942 --> 01:31:38,542
I'll bet you were glad
when your old pal spider-man

1730
01:31:38,544 --> 01:31:42,146
showed up in the elevator though...

1731
01:31:43,548 --> 01:31:45,416
Yeah, well, I actually
didn't go up.

1732
01:31:45,418 --> 01:31:47,752
I saw it all from the ground.

1733
01:31:48,154 --> 01:31:49,421
<i>Yeah.</i>

1734
01:31:49,723 --> 01:31:52,357
Very lucky that
he was there that day.

1735
01:31:55,327 --> 01:31:57,796
Good old spider-man.

1736
01:32:01,667 --> 01:32:03,469
Dad, the light.

1737
01:32:18,952 --> 01:32:21,252
Here we are.
End of the line.

1738
01:32:21,254 --> 01:32:22,520
Thanks, dad.

1739
01:32:23,022 --> 01:32:24,422
You head in there, gumdrop.

1740
01:32:24,424 --> 01:32:28,760
I'm gonna give Peter
the "dad" talk.

1741
01:32:29,394 --> 01:32:31,462
Don't let him intimidate you.

1742
01:32:31,464 --> 01:32:32,764
Love you.

1743
01:32:32,766 --> 01:32:35,466
- Love you, gumdrop.
- Have a safe flight.

1744
01:32:35,468 --> 01:32:37,335
<i>Hi.</i>

1745
01:32:37,737 --> 01:32:40,305
<i>You guys look so pretty.</i>

1746
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:46,511
Does she know?

1747
01:32:47,013 --> 01:32:48,547
Know what?

1748
01:32:48,748 --> 01:32:50,214
So she doesn't. Good.

1749
01:32:50,516 --> 01:32:53,384
Close to the vest.
I admire that.

1750
01:32:53,586 --> 01:32:56,054
I've got a few secrets
of my own.

1751
01:32:56,356 --> 01:32:57,455
Of all the reasons

1752
01:32:57,457 --> 01:33:00,258
I didn't want
my daughter to date...

1753
01:33:02,461 --> 01:33:03,695
Peter,

1754
01:33:03,797 --> 01:33:06,230
nothing is more important
than family.

1755
01:33:06,232 --> 01:33:07,965
You saved my daughter's life.

1756
01:33:08,167 --> 01:33:10,234
I could never forget
something like that.

1757
01:33:10,236 --> 01:33:12,303
So I'm gonna give you
one chance.

1758
01:33:12,405 --> 01:33:13,404
Are you ready?

1759
01:33:14,006 --> 01:33:15,173
You walk through those doors,

1760
01:33:15,175 --> 01:33:17,375
you forget any of this happened

1761
01:33:17,377 --> 01:33:19,410
and don't you ever,

1762
01:33:19,412 --> 01:33:20,511
ever

1763
01:33:21,113 --> 01:33:23,581
interfere with
my business again.

1764
01:33:23,883 --> 01:33:25,550
'Cause if you do,

1765
01:33:25,952 --> 01:33:27,496
I'll kill you

1766
01:33:28,287 --> 01:33:30,355
and everybody you love.

1767
01:33:31,257 --> 01:33:32,590
I'll kill you dead.

1768
01:33:32,792 --> 01:33:35,059
That's what I'll do
to protect my family, Pete.

1769
01:33:35,261 --> 01:33:36,962
Do you understand?

1770
01:33:37,764 --> 01:33:38,764
Hey.

1771
01:33:40,566 --> 01:33:44,202
I just saved your life.
Now what do you say?

1772
01:33:46,238 --> 01:33:47,238
Thank you.

1773
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:49,240
You're welcome.

1774
01:33:49,442 --> 01:33:51,342
Now, you go on in there,

1775
01:33:51,844 --> 01:33:55,313
you show my daughter
a good time, okay?

1776
01:33:56,015 --> 01:33:58,082
Just not too good.

1777
01:34:51,704 --> 01:34:52,648
Hey.

1778
01:34:54,941 --> 01:34:57,441
What did he say to you?

1779
01:35:00,712 --> 01:35:02,280
I've got to go.

1780
01:35:03,949 --> 01:35:05,650
I'm... I'm sorry.

1781
01:35:05,952 --> 01:35:07,853
You don't deserve this.

1782
01:35:26,271 --> 01:35:28,240
Ah...!
Oh...

1783
01:35:29,242 --> 01:35:30,541
He gave you a choice.

1784
01:35:30,743 --> 01:35:32,977
- You chose wrong.
- What the hell?

1785
01:35:32,979 --> 01:35:35,013
What's with the crappy costume?

1786
01:35:37,117 --> 01:35:38,650
My web-shooters.

1787
01:35:43,456 --> 01:35:44,690
Whoa...!

1788
01:35:47,392 --> 01:35:49,260
I wasn't sure about
this thing at first, but...

1789
01:35:50,862 --> 01:35:51,863
Damn!

1790
01:35:56,436 --> 01:35:58,437
Oh, gross.

1791
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:13,451
- Why did he send you here?
- Guess you'll never know.

1792
01:36:16,488 --> 01:36:17,524
Huh?

1793
01:36:17,989 --> 01:36:19,189
Nice shot!

1794
01:36:24,462 --> 01:36:25,463
Yeah!

1795
01:36:25,965 --> 01:36:27,965
Ned, the guy with the wings
is Liz's dad.

1796
01:36:27,967 --> 01:36:29,966
- What?
- I know. I gotta tell Mr. Stark.

1797
01:36:29,968 --> 01:36:32,403
Call happy hogan. He's
Mr. Stark's head of security.

1798
01:36:32,405 --> 01:36:34,538
And ah... get a computer
and track my phone for me.

1799
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:36,474
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Hurry, we gotta catch him

1800
01:36:36,476 --> 01:36:38,276
before he leaves town!

1801
01:36:38,778 --> 01:36:39,877
I'm sorry about dinner,

1802
01:36:39,879 --> 01:36:42,547
but...
I know when branzino's fresh,

1803
01:36:42,749 --> 01:36:44,315
and that was not fresh, okay?

1804
01:36:44,317 --> 01:36:45,549
So, aahh!!

1805
01:36:46,151 --> 01:36:48,085
Flash, I need your car
and your phone.

1806
01:36:48,087 --> 01:36:50,989
Sir, technically,
this is my dad's car, sir, so I can't...

1807
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:55,293
Ah!

1808
01:36:59,297 --> 01:37:01,432
Hello, Ned?
Hey, hey, can you hear me?

1809
01:37:01,434 --> 01:37:02,533
Go for ned.

1810
01:37:02,835 --> 01:37:05,036
Ned, I need you
to track my phone for me.

1811
01:37:05,038 --> 01:37:06,439
Yeah, but where is it?

1812
01:37:10,608 --> 01:37:12,242
Genius move.
Okay, he just passed

1813
01:37:12,244 --> 01:37:13,277
the gamestop on Jackson Avenue.

1814
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:15,446
Hey, where are the headlights
on this thing?

1815
01:37:15,448 --> 01:37:17,782
- I'm in flash's car.
- I'll pull the specs.

1816
01:37:17,984 --> 01:37:19,283
Okay, you're on speakerphone.

1817
01:37:19,285 --> 01:37:21,252
You stole flash's car?
Awesome.

1818
01:37:21,254 --> 01:37:22,887
Yeah, it's awesome!
It's aweso...

1819
01:37:23,089 --> 01:37:24,321
Oh!
Get out of the way!

1820
01:37:24,323 --> 01:37:25,889
Get out of the way!
Move! Move!

1821
01:37:25,891 --> 01:37:28,059
- Peter, are you okay?
<i>-I've never driven before.</i>

1822
01:37:28,061 --> 01:37:29,593
Only with May in parking lots.

1823
01:37:29,595 --> 01:37:32,463
This is a huge step up.
Whoa!

1824
01:37:33,465 --> 01:37:34,932
<i>Hey, have you gotten
through to Happy yet?</i>

1825
01:37:34,934 --> 01:37:36,133
Uh, yeah.
I'm working on it.

1826
01:37:36,135 --> 01:37:37,803
I just gotta backdoor
the phone system.

1827
01:37:41,907 --> 01:37:43,608
Guy in the chair.

1828
01:37:48,447 --> 01:37:49,847
<i>Takeoff in nine minutes.</i>

1829
01:37:49,849 --> 01:37:51,849
<i>Hello? Hello?
Who is this?</i>

1830
01:37:51,951 --> 01:37:53,651
- Mr. Happy, it's Ned.
<i>- Who?</i>

1831
01:37:53,653 --> 01:37:54,819
I'm an associate of Peter Parker.

1832
01:37:54,821 --> 01:37:56,220
Got something important
to tell you...

1833
01:37:56,222 --> 01:37:59,190
<i>- You gotta be shitting me.</i>
- Damn.

1834
01:37:59,592 --> 01:38:01,426
Hey, ned, how we coming
with those headlights?

1835
01:38:01,428 --> 01:38:02,228
Uh...

1836
01:38:03,629 --> 01:38:05,763
Round knob to the left
of the steering wheel,

1837
01:38:05,765 --> 01:38:07,465
<i>- turn clockwise.</i>
- Left, okay.

1838
01:38:08,067 --> 01:38:10,233
Okay, perfect.
So where's my phone now?

1839
01:38:10,235 --> 01:38:13,204
Um... He stopped in an old
industrial park in Brooklyn.

1840
01:38:13,206 --> 01:38:14,472
What?
That makes no sense!

1841
01:38:14,474 --> 01:38:16,140
I thought he said he was
going out of town!

1842
01:38:16,342 --> 01:38:18,042
<i>Weird.
Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.</i>

1843
01:38:18,044 --> 01:38:19,510
Don't think he likes you,
by the way.

1844
01:38:19,512 --> 01:38:21,178
It sounded like he was
catching a flight.

1845
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:23,047
<i>He said something about
taking off in nine minutes.</i>

1846
01:38:23,049 --> 01:38:25,116
<i>- What?</i>
- He was surrounded by bunch of boxes.

1847
01:38:25,118 --> 01:38:26,517
Boxes? It's moving day.

1848
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:28,886
It's moving day.
He's gonna rob that plane.

1849
01:38:28,888 --> 01:38:30,456
I gotta stop him!

1850
01:38:33,925 --> 01:38:35,592
All right, wheels up
in eight minutes.

1851
01:38:35,794 --> 01:38:38,329
We just got to load Tony's
old hulkbuster armor,

1852
01:38:38,331 --> 01:38:41,732
prototype for cap's new shield,
and the meging...

1853
01:38:42,234 --> 01:38:45,470
The meg... the...
Thor's magic belt.

1854
01:38:46,538 --> 01:38:48,272
Okay, slow down.
You're getting close.

1855
01:38:48,274 --> 01:38:49,707
<i>- It's on your right.</i>
- What?

1856
01:38:49,709 --> 01:38:51,309
<i>Turn right!
Turn right!</i>

1857
01:39:00,518 --> 01:39:02,486
- Peter, are you okay?
- Yeah.

1858
01:39:02,988 --> 01:39:05,523
Just keep trying
to get through to Happy.

1859
01:39:05,725 --> 01:39:07,392
It's been an honor,
spider-man.

1860
01:39:08,194 --> 01:39:10,038
What are you doing here?
There's a dance.

1861
01:39:10,997 --> 01:39:12,431
Uh...

1862
01:39:14,499 --> 01:39:17,268
I'm looking...

1863
01:39:17,270 --> 01:39:19,338
at porn.

1864
01:39:57,909 --> 01:39:59,310
Hey!

1865
01:40:00,413 --> 01:40:01,857
Surprised?

1866
01:40:01,948 --> 01:40:03,347
Oh, hey, Pete.

1867
01:40:04,349 --> 01:40:05,849
I didn't hear you come in.

1868
01:40:05,851 --> 01:40:07,751
It's over.
I've got you!

1869
01:40:08,153 --> 01:40:10,354
You know,
i gotta tell you, Pete,

1870
01:40:10,756 --> 01:40:13,825
I really, really admire
your grit.

1871
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:17,328
I see why Liz likes you.

1872
01:40:18,496 --> 01:40:20,698
I do. When you first
came to the house,

1873
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:22,767
I wasn't sure.
I thought, "really?"

1874
01:40:22,769 --> 01:40:23,901
But I get it now.

1875
01:40:24,703 --> 01:40:26,436
How could you do this to her?

1876
01:40:26,638 --> 01:40:28,873
To her? I'm not doing
anything to her, Pete.

1877
01:40:28,875 --> 01:40:30,875
I'm doing this for her.

1878
01:40:30,977 --> 01:40:32,811
Huh, yeah.

1879
01:40:36,782 --> 01:40:38,016
Peter,

1880
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:40,252
you're young.

1881
01:40:40,253 --> 01:40:42,520
You don't understand
how the world works.

1882
01:40:42,522 --> 01:40:43,521
Yeah, but I understand

1883
01:40:43,523 --> 01:40:45,422
that selling weapons
to criminals is wrong.

1884
01:40:45,724 --> 01:40:48,292
How do you think your buddy
Stark paid for that tower?

1885
01:40:48,294 --> 01:40:49,727
Or any of his little toys?

1886
01:40:50,129 --> 01:40:52,095
Those people, Pete,
those people up there,

1887
01:40:52,097 --> 01:40:54,565
the rich and the powerful,
they do whatever they want.

1888
01:40:54,567 --> 01:40:56,068
Guys like us,

1889
01:40:56,523 --> 01:40:57,790
like you and me,

1890
01:40:58,470 --> 01:40:59,803
they don't care about us.

1891
01:41:00,005 --> 01:41:02,406
We build their roads
and we fight all their wars

1892
01:41:02,408 --> 01:41:05,009
and everything, but they
don't care about us.

1893
01:41:05,211 --> 01:41:06,543
We have to pick up after 'em.

1894
01:41:06,545 --> 01:41:08,980
We have to eat
their table scraps.

1895
01:41:10,682 --> 01:41:12,183
That's how it is.

1896
01:41:12,985 --> 01:41:15,052
I know you know what
I'm talking about, Peter.

1897
01:41:15,254 --> 01:41:16,821
Why are you telling me this?

1898
01:41:17,223 --> 01:41:19,657
Because I want you
to understand.

1899
01:41:19,759 --> 01:41:20,991
and...

1900
01:41:21,394 --> 01:41:24,597
I needed a little time
to get her airborne.

1901
01:41:37,175 --> 01:41:38,777
I'm sorry, Peter.

1902
01:41:41,746 --> 01:41:42,846
What are you talking about?

1903
01:41:42,848 --> 01:41:45,116
That thing hasn't even
touched me yet.

1904
01:41:46,018 --> 01:41:47,718
True. Then again,

1905
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:50,288
wasn't really trying to.

1906
01:41:56,193 --> 01:41:57,461
<i>Chief, they're
powering up engines.</i>

1907
01:41:57,463 --> 01:42:00,265
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
<i>- Come on, come on, come on.</i>

1908
01:42:46,010 --> 01:42:47,780
Oh, god.

1909
01:42:52,118 --> 01:42:53,351
Okay, ready...

1910
01:43:02,695 --> 01:43:04,429
Hello!

1911
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:08,599
Helloooo!!

1912
01:43:08,701 --> 01:43:10,334
Please. Hey.

1913
01:43:10,636 --> 01:43:13,204
Hey, please.
I'm down here.

1914
01:43:13,206 --> 01:43:14,772
I'm down here.
I'm stuck.

1915
01:43:14,974 --> 01:43:18,042
I'm stuck. I can't move.
I can't...

1916
01:43:34,725 --> 01:43:36,527
<i>If you're nothing
without this suit,</i>

1917
01:43:36,929 --> 01:43:39,130
<i>then you shouldn't have it.</i>

1918
01:43:44,703 --> 01:43:46,303
Come on, Peter.

1919
01:43:46,705 --> 01:43:48,372
Come on, spider-man.

1920
01:43:48,474 --> 01:43:50,541
Come on, spider-man.

1921
01:43:50,643 --> 01:43:52,444
Come on, spider-man.

1922
01:43:54,712 --> 01:43:56,747
Come on, spider-man!

1923
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:49,867
Launch for intercept.
Green light. Green light.

1924
01:44:50,169 --> 01:44:51,236
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1925
01:45:06,651 --> 01:45:09,020
Retroreflective panels engaged.

1926
01:45:20,931 --> 01:45:22,565
<i>Got a visual on the plane,</i>

1927
01:45:22,567 --> 01:45:23,933
<i>but I'm feeling a little resistance.</i>

1928
01:45:23,935 --> 01:45:26,037
<i>It's probably just drag
on the new turbines.</i>

1929
01:45:29,542 --> 01:45:30,786
Ah!

1930
01:45:31,944 --> 01:45:33,945
Whoaa...

1931
01:45:39,249 --> 01:45:40,517
<i>Look out for
the cloaking cameras.</i>

1932
01:45:40,519 --> 01:45:42,153
<i>Stay in the blind spots.</i>

1933
01:45:52,030 --> 01:45:53,664
Oh, My God!
Oh, My God!

1934
01:45:54,266 --> 01:45:56,833
Deploy high-altitude vacuum seal.

1935
01:45:56,835 --> 01:45:58,703
<i>This better work, Mason.</i>

1936
01:46:03,941 --> 01:46:05,709
<i>Trust me, boss,
even one of those boxes</i>

1937
01:46:05,711 --> 01:46:08,279
<i>- and we are set for life.
- Yeah.</i>

1938
01:46:19,489 --> 01:46:20,489
Ah! Wooh...!

1939
01:46:20,524 --> 01:46:22,159
<i>You have 30 seconds
to get to the cockpit</i>

1940
01:46:22,161 --> 01:46:23,828
<i>and override their security.</i>

1941
01:46:35,673 --> 01:46:37,408
<i>Cloning transponder signal.</i>

1942
01:46:37,410 --> 01:46:39,076
Launching decoy drone.

1943
01:46:43,214 --> 01:46:45,218
<i>Entering new coordinates.</i>

1944
01:46:51,522 --> 01:46:52,656
Good, so it's on its way?

1945
01:46:52,658 --> 01:46:55,260
- Yes, sir, right on course.
- Okay, thank you.

1946
01:46:56,362 --> 01:46:57,806
All right.

1947
01:47:10,442 --> 01:47:12,076
Hot dog.

1948
01:48:01,559 --> 01:48:03,160
Just a typical homecoming

1949
01:48:03,562 --> 01:48:06,129
on the outside of an invisible jet...

1950
01:48:06,631 --> 01:48:08,432
Fighting my girlfriend's dad.

1951
01:48:08,434 --> 01:48:11,369
Oh! Oh! Oh! Ahh!

1952
01:48:17,910 --> 01:48:19,344
Oh, God!

1953
01:48:26,350 --> 01:48:28,752
Wooh!
I can't believe that worked.

1954
01:49:05,256 --> 01:49:07,658
Chief, they're losing altitude.
Get out of there.

1955
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:09,627
<i>I'm not going home
empty-handed.</i>

1956
01:49:19,503 --> 01:49:20,905
Oh, My God.

1957
01:49:35,553 --> 01:49:37,320
<i>Get out of there.
What are you doing?</i>

1958
01:49:37,322 --> 01:49:38,957
Please turn!
Please turn!

1959
01:51:13,618 --> 01:51:15,353
<i>Hey, Pedro.</i>

1960
01:52:02,867 --> 01:52:04,301
<i>Bingo.</i>

1961
01:52:19,917 --> 01:52:21,184
Your wingsuit.

1962
01:52:21,386 --> 01:52:23,588
Your wingsuit's gonna explode!

1963
01:52:31,429 --> 01:52:32,863
Time to go home, Pete.

1964
01:52:32,965 --> 01:52:35,365
I'm trying to save you!

1965
01:52:51,784 --> 01:52:52,850
No!

1966
01:54:08,144 --> 01:54:10,144
<font color="#00ff00"><u>FOUND</u>
FLYING VULTURE GUY

<font color="#00ff00">PS. SORRY ABOUT YOUR PLANE</font>

1968
01:54:32,850 --> 01:54:34,751
It looked so insane.
That whole...

1969
01:54:34,853 --> 01:54:36,486
Like, it was just crazy.

1970
01:54:36,488 --> 01:54:38,155
He was just, like...

1971
01:54:39,057 --> 01:54:40,923
And you were
like, "ah!"

1972
01:54:41,025 --> 01:54:43,159
And then I just hit him
with the "ffuuhhh."

1973
01:54:43,161 --> 01:54:45,295
It was so...
Oh, my God.

1974
01:54:45,397 --> 01:54:46,897
You saved me.

1975
01:54:47,599 --> 01:54:48,833
Awesome.

1976
01:54:55,173 --> 01:54:56,774
Hey, Liz!

1977
01:54:58,376 --> 01:54:59,876
I'm gonna miss you.

1978
01:55:00,078 --> 01:55:01,179
Bye.

1979
01:55:02,181 --> 01:55:03,214
Liz.

1980
01:55:10,487 --> 01:55:12,288
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.

1981
01:55:12,590 --> 01:55:13,424
You say that a lot.

1982
01:55:13,425 --> 01:55:15,192
What are you sorry
for this time?

1983
01:55:17,228 --> 01:55:18,762
The dance?

1984
01:55:19,264 --> 01:55:22,532
That um...
was a pretty crappy thing to do.

1985
01:55:22,534 --> 01:55:24,800
Yeah, but i...
I mean, your dad...

1986
01:55:24,802 --> 01:55:26,402
I can't imagine what
you're going through.

1987
01:55:26,904 --> 01:55:28,471
If there's anything
i can do to help...

1988
01:55:29,273 --> 01:55:31,307
I guess we're moving to Oregon.

1989
01:55:31,909 --> 01:55:35,278
Mom says it's nice there,
so that's cool.

1990
01:55:35,980 --> 01:55:38,281
Anyways, dad doesn't
want us here

1991
01:55:38,283 --> 01:55:40,351
during the trial, so...

1992
01:55:41,785 --> 01:55:43,954
Liz, i... i...

1993
01:55:44,556 --> 01:55:46,056
Bye, Peter.

1994
01:55:46,958 --> 01:55:48,458
Whatever's going on with you,

1995
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:50,294
I hope you figure it out.

1996
01:56:02,973 --> 01:56:06,743
Congratulations,
decathlon national champions.

1997
01:56:06,745 --> 01:56:08,189
Yeah!

1998
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:11,114
I'm gonna have to put this
back in the trophy case soon,

1999
01:56:11,115 --> 01:56:13,750
but just for motivation
right now at this practice.

2000
01:56:14,352 --> 01:56:15,485
I'm a little ahead of the game, but...

2001
01:56:15,487 --> 01:56:17,521
we will need a new
team captain next year.

2002
01:56:17,822 --> 01:56:20,726
So I am appointing Michelle.

2003
01:56:21,327 --> 01:56:23,171
Yeah!

2004
01:56:25,296 --> 01:56:26,340
Uh, thank you.

2005
01:56:26,631 --> 01:56:28,075
My... my friends call me MJ.

2006
01:56:28,666 --> 01:56:30,734
I thought you didn't
have any friends.

2007
01:56:30,736 --> 01:56:32,936
I... didn't.

2008
01:56:37,841 --> 01:56:40,443
- I gotta go.
- Hey, where you going?

2009
01:56:42,479 --> 01:56:44,915
What are you hiding, Peter?

2010
01:56:46,817 --> 01:56:48,418
I'm just kidding.
I don't care. Bye.

2011
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:50,720
All right,
so we should run some drills.

2012
01:56:50,722 --> 01:56:51,756
Yeah.

2013
01:56:59,863 --> 01:57:03,267
Hey, Happy. What...
What are you doing here?

2014
01:57:04,068 --> 01:57:05,769
I really owe you one.

2015
01:57:07,271 --> 01:57:09,606
I don't know what I would do
without this job.

2016
01:57:09,808 --> 01:57:11,374
I mean, before I met Tony...

2017
01:57:41,539 --> 01:57:43,373
So how long you been here?

2018
01:57:43,375 --> 01:57:45,942
Long enough to be awkward.
Boss wants to see you.

2019
01:57:46,544 --> 01:57:47,744
Is he here too?

2020
01:57:48,146 --> 01:57:49,590
In the toilet?
No, he's upstate.

2021
01:57:50,081 --> 01:57:52,015
Upstate?
Like, upstate-upstate?

2022
01:57:52,017 --> 01:57:53,484
Yeah, let's go.

2023
01:57:54,818 --> 01:57:55,985
Take a look.

2024
01:57:56,087 --> 01:57:57,921
It's pretty impressive, huh?

2025
01:57:59,023 --> 01:58:01,425
They just finished
remodeling the whole thing.

2026
01:58:28,018 --> 01:58:31,854
- You don't see that every day.
- Oh, there they are.

2027
01:58:31,856 --> 01:58:34,590
- How was the ride up?
- Good.

2028
01:58:34,792 --> 01:58:36,660
Give me a minute with the kid.

2029
01:58:37,462 --> 01:58:39,229
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

2030
01:58:39,631 --> 01:58:41,231
I got to talk to the kid.

2031
01:58:41,633 --> 01:58:42,832
I'll be close behind.

2032
01:58:42,934 --> 01:58:44,178
How about a loose follow?

2033
01:58:44,269 --> 01:58:46,104
All right?
Boundaries are good.

2034
01:58:51,708 --> 01:58:52,909
Sorry I took your suit.

2035
01:58:52,911 --> 01:58:54,377
I mean, you had it coming.

2036
01:58:54,579 --> 01:58:56,112
Actually, it turns
out it was the perfect

2037
01:58:56,114 --> 01:58:57,880
sort of tough-love moment
that you needed, right?

2038
01:58:57,882 --> 01:58:59,482
To urge you on?
Wouldn't you think?

2039
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:01,051
- Don't you think?
- I guess.

2040
01:59:01,053 --> 01:59:02,352
Let's just say it was.

2041
01:59:04,354 --> 01:59:05,355
Mr. Stark, I really...

2042
01:59:05,357 --> 01:59:07,801
You screwed the pooch hard,
bigtime.

2043
01:59:08,292 --> 01:59:09,826
But then you did
the right thing.

2044
01:59:10,128 --> 01:59:11,594
Took the dog to the free clinic,

2045
01:59:11,596 --> 01:59:13,596
you raised the hybrid puppies.

2046
01:59:13,598 --> 01:59:15,402
All right, not my best analogy.

2047
01:59:16,601 --> 01:59:18,268
I was wrong about you.

2048
01:59:18,870 --> 01:59:21,070
I think, with a little
more mentoring,

2049
01:59:21,572 --> 01:59:23,473
you could be a real asset
to the team.

2050
01:59:25,576 --> 01:59:27,476
- To the... to the team?
- Yeah. Anyway,

2051
01:59:27,478 --> 01:59:29,379
there's about 50 reporters
behind that door.

2052
01:59:29,381 --> 01:59:30,881
Real ones, not bloggers.

2053
01:59:31,284 --> 01:59:32,517
When you're ready,

2054
01:59:33,518 --> 01:59:35,118
why don't you try that on?

2055
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:36,986
And I'll introduce the world

2056
01:59:36,988 --> 01:59:39,489
the newest official
member of the avengers,

2057
01:59:39,491 --> 01:59:41,091
Spider-man.

2058
01:59:43,694 --> 01:59:44,894
I...

2059
01:59:46,898 --> 01:59:48,766
Yeah, give that a look.

2060
01:59:54,538 --> 01:59:55,805
So after the press conference,

2061
01:59:55,807 --> 01:59:58,074
Happy will show you
to your room, your new quarters.

2062
01:59:58,076 --> 02:00:00,343
Where's he between?
He's next to vision?

2063
02:00:00,645 --> 02:00:02,278
Yeah, vision's not big on doors.

2064
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:04,480
- It's fun.
- Or walls.

2065
02:00:04,582 --> 02:00:06,383
You'll fit right in.

2066
02:00:12,689 --> 02:00:14,691
Thank you, Mr. Stark...

2067
02:00:15,293 --> 02:00:16,459
but I'm... I'm good.

2068
02:00:17,461 --> 02:00:19,629
You're good?
How are you good?

2069
02:00:20,331 --> 02:00:22,799
Well, I mean,
I'd rather just stay

2070
02:00:22,801 --> 02:00:24,200
on the ground, for a little while.

2071
02:00:24,702 --> 02:00:26,436
Friendly neighborhood spider-man.

2072
02:00:27,138 --> 02:00:29,105
Somebody's got to look out
for the little guy, right?

2073
02:00:29,307 --> 02:00:30,640
You're turning me down?

2074
02:00:31,042 --> 02:00:32,943
You better think about this.
Look at that.

2075
02:00:33,145 --> 02:00:34,277
Look at me.

2076
02:00:35,379 --> 02:00:36,446
Last chance.
Yes or no?

2077
02:00:36,448 --> 02:00:37,580
- No.
- Okay.

2078
02:00:37,882 --> 02:00:39,115
It's kind of a Springsteen-y,

2079
02:00:39,117 --> 02:00:41,050
working-class hero vibe that I dig.

2080
02:00:41,352 --> 02:00:43,586
Ah, Happy will take you home.

2081
02:00:43,788 --> 02:00:44,887
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

2082
02:00:45,489 --> 02:00:47,724
Mind waiting in the car?
I need a minute.

2083
02:00:49,059 --> 02:00:50,126
Thank you, Mr. Stark.

2084
02:00:50,128 --> 02:00:51,928
Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.

2085
02:00:51,930 --> 02:00:53,364
- See you around.
- Okay.

2086
02:01:01,872 --> 02:01:03,206
That was a test, right?

2087
02:01:04,008 --> 02:01:05,441
There's nobody back there?

2088
02:01:05,443 --> 02:01:06,476
Yes, you passed.

2089
02:01:07,278 --> 02:01:08,722
All right, skedaddle there...

2090
02:01:08,813 --> 02:01:10,480
- Thank you, Mr. Stark. Thank you.
- ...young buck.

2091
02:01:10,482 --> 02:01:12,149
Yeah, thank you.

2092
02:01:13,851 --> 02:01:15,486
Told you he was a good kid.

2093
02:01:20,022 --> 02:01:21,891
<i>Pepper! Pepper!</i>

2094
02:01:22,193 --> 02:01:23,159
Where's the kid?

2095
02:01:23,161 --> 02:01:24,494
- He left.
- Everybody's waiting.

2096
02:01:24,596 --> 02:01:26,662
You know, he actually made
a really mature choice.

2097
02:01:26,864 --> 02:01:28,464
It just surprised
the heck out of us.

2098
02:01:28,566 --> 02:01:29,865
Did you guys screw this up?

2099
02:01:29,867 --> 02:01:31,111
He told the kid
to wait in the car.

2100
02:01:31,202 --> 02:01:33,836
Are you kidding me?
I have a room full of people

2101
02:01:33,838 --> 02:01:36,539
and their waiting for some big announcement.
What am I gonna tell them?

2102
02:01:36,541 --> 02:01:39,208
Think of something.
How about, um...

2103
02:01:39,610 --> 02:01:41,111
Hap, you still got that ring?

2104
02:01:41,114 --> 02:01:42,212
Do i... i...

2105
02:01:42,213 --> 02:01:43,579
- The engagement ring.
- Are you kidding?

2106
02:01:43,581 --> 02:01:45,717
I've been carrying
this since 2008.

2107
02:01:49,186 --> 02:01:50,086
Okay.

2108
02:01:50,488 --> 02:01:52,154
I think I can think of
something better than that.

2109
02:01:52,356 --> 02:01:54,391
Well, it would buy us a little time.

2110
02:01:56,093 --> 02:01:57,460
Like we need time.

2111
02:01:58,162 --> 02:01:59,862
I can't believe you have
that thing in your pocket.

2112
02:01:59,864 --> 02:02:01,064
Let me to get the door
for you, hon?

2113
02:02:01,066 --> 02:02:02,100
<i>I got it.</i>

2114
02:02:18,715 --> 02:02:20,651
Aunt May,
did you do dinner already?

2115
02:02:31,729 --> 02:02:33,173
May?

2116
02:02:40,795 --> 02:02:53,239
{\an3}<font color="#0080ff">i m o t o m m y</font>
<font color="#00ff00">subscene.com</font>

2117
02:02:54,985 --> 02:02:56,029
What the f***?!

2118
02:05:10,153 --> 02:05:12,622
Look who it is.

2119
02:05:13,890 --> 02:05:15,291
What are the odds
you and I'd end up

2120
02:05:15,293 --> 02:05:16,927
at the same summer camp?

2121
02:05:17,329 --> 02:05:18,594
Relax.

2122
02:05:19,296 --> 02:05:20,963
This?
It's not on you.

2123
02:05:21,465 --> 02:05:24,400
It's on our...
little spider friend.

2124
02:05:24,802 --> 02:05:26,368
I've got some boys
on the outside

2125
02:05:26,370 --> 02:05:28,304
who would love to meet him.

2126
02:05:28,306 --> 02:05:29,605
You know, take a picture,

2127
02:05:29,707 --> 02:05:32,174
slice his throat,
put his head in a dryer.

2128
02:05:32,476 --> 02:05:34,911
And I heard a rumor...

2129
02:05:37,881 --> 02:05:39,683
You know who he is.

2130
02:05:43,287 --> 02:05:45,555
If I knew who he was,

2131
02:05:45,657 --> 02:05:47,657
he'd already be dead.

2132
02:05:51,895 --> 02:05:54,799
Toomes, your family's here!

2133
02:12:33,796 --> 02:12:36,732
Hi, I'm captain America,
here to talk to you

2134
02:12:36,734 --> 02:12:38,500
about one of the most
valuable traits

2135
02:12:38,502 --> 02:12:40,703
a soldier or student can have.

2136
02:12:41,005 --> 02:12:42,149
Patience.

2137
02:12:42,473 --> 02:12:44,907
Sometimes Patience
is the key to victory.

2138
02:12:44,909 --> 02:12:46,953
Sometimes it leads to very little

2139
02:12:47,244 --> 02:12:49,245
and it seems like
it's not worth it.

2140
02:12:49,747 --> 02:12:51,213
And you wonder...

2141
02:12:51,515 --> 02:12:52,781
why you waited so long

2142
02:12:52,783 --> 02:12:55,385
for something so disappointing.

2143
02:12:59,055 --> 02:13:01,099
How many more of these?
