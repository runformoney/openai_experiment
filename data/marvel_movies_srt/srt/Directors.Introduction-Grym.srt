My name's Taika Waititi.
I am the director of Thor: Ragnarok.

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,134
Ultimately, this film is about

3
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:13,805
Thor, Ragnarok and his journey

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,476
into some outer space places.

5
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,646
<i>People often ask me,
"Why did you become a filmmaker?"</i>

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:24,775
Well, the main reason...
Just wanted to impress my mom and dad,

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,487
and to show them, "I'm not a loser!
I don't care what you say!

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,322
"I can achieve some dreams,

9
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,241
"not my own dreams,
but other people's dreams!

10
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,826
"I can get close to being J.J. Abrams.

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,496
"I know you wanted him as a son.
But you got me.

12
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,081
"I'm sorry I'm not J.J. Abrams."

13
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:42,334
They said, "All right, Taika!
Wish we called you J.J. Abrams!

14
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,045
"Would've been so much cooler.
You'd have done Star Wars."

15
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,065
"Well, I didn't.
All right, Mom and Dad? I didn't.

16
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:48,173
"You're stuck with me."

17
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,677
<i>Okay. Now, down to the nifty-gritty.</i>

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,515
<i>Why did I make this film?
For kudos and followers on Twitter.</i>

19
00:00:56,932 --> 00:01:01,103
What I really wanted to do with Thor
was capture the essence of Peter Pan,

20
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,982
a <i>little bit of Terminator 2,</i>
a dash <i>of Independence Day,</i>

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:09,861
a <i>smidgen of On Golden Pond
with</i> a <i>tone of Beaches,</i>

22
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:13,699
<i>mixed in with My Fair Lady.</i>

23
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,159
So, I think I've achieved that.

24
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,579
<i>At the end of the day,
when all's said and done,</i>

25
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:19,663
<i>the film's about</i>

26
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:25,043
<i>some monsters, some explosions,
pretty ladies, handsome men...</i>

27
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,754
There's a Hulk.
Then it's the credits at the end

28
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,440
with all the names
of the people who made it.

29
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,466
<i>That's what we tried to do,
and I think we did it.</i>

30
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,803
That's what I wanted to achieve
with this film.

31
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,599
Full respect from Taika Waititi
from New Zealand.
