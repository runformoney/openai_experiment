2
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:16,730
Master Kaecilius.

3
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:21,485
That ritual will
bring you only sorrow.

4
00:02:57,312 --> 00:02:58,981
Hypocrite!

5
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:56,196
Challenge round, Billy.

6
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:02,369
Oh, come on, Billy.
You've got to be messing with me.

7
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,662
No, doctor.

8
00:05:04,663 --> 00:05:07,332
Feels So Good,
Chuck Mangione, 1977.

9
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:09,572
Seriously, Billy,
you said this one would be hard.

10
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:11,086
Hah!
It's 1978.

11
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:14,006
No, Billy, while Feels So Good
may have charted in 1978,

12
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:17,509
the album was released in December,
1977.

13
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:20,179
- No, no. Wikipedia says the...
- Check again.

14
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:22,848
Where do you store all
this useless information?

15
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:26,518
Useless? The man charted a
top ten hit with a Flugelhorn.

16
00:05:26,852 --> 00:05:28,421
Status, Billy?
- 1977.

17
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,189
Oh!
Please.

18
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:30,939
I hate you.

19
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:34,860
Woah!
"Feels so good", doesn't it?

20
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:40,407
Oh, I... I've got this, Stephen. You've
done your bit. Go ahead, we'll close up.

21
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,493
- What is that?
- GSW.

22
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:47,664
It's amazing you
kept him alive.

23
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:49,666
Apneic, further brain stem
testing after reflex test...

24
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,752
I think I found the problem, Dr. Palmer.

25
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:55,255
- You left a bullet in his head.
- Thanks. It's impinging on the medulla.

26
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,841
I needed a specialist to
diagnose brain death.

27
00:05:57,841 --> 00:06:00,427
Something about that
doesn't feel right to me.

28
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:01,428
We have to run.

29
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:06,850
- Dr. West! What are you doing? Hey!
- Organ harvesting. He's a donor.

30
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,852
- Slow down. I did not agree to that.
- I don't

31
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:10,854
need you to. We've already
called brain death.

32
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:13,315
Too premature. We need to get him
prepped for a suboccipital craniotomy.

33
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:14,850
I'm not going to let you
operate on a dead man.

34
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,984
What do you see?

35
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:18,987
- A bullet?
- A perfect bullet. It's been hardened.

36
00:06:18,987 --> 00:06:22,074
You harden a bullet by
alloying lead with antimony.

37
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:24,743
A toxic metal. And as it leaks directly
into the cerebral spinal fluid...

38
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:27,020
Rapid-onset central
nervous system shutdown.

39
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,413
He had to go.

40
00:06:28,413 --> 00:06:31,583
The patient's not dead, but he's dying.
Do you still want to harvest his organs?

41
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,420
- I'll assist you.
- No! Dr. Palmer will assist me.

42
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,480
Thank you.

43
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:02,906
- Image status, STAT.
- We do not have time for that.

44
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:06,493
- You can't do it by hand.
- I can and I will.

45
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,829
This isn't the time
for showing off, Strange.

46
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,748
How about ten minutes ago, when
you called the wrong time of death?

47
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,259
Cranial nerves intact.

48
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:49,578
Dr. West, cover your watch.

49
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,665
You know, you didn't have to
humiliate him in front of everyone.

50
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:38,084
I didn't have to save his
patient either. But,

51
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,203
you know, sometimes
i just can't help myself.

52
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,714
- Nick is a great doctor.
- You came to me.

53
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:45,550
- Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.
- You had a second opinion.

54
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,594
- What you needed was a competent one.
- Well, all the

55
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:49,763
more reason why you should
be my neurosurgeon on call.

56
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,181
You could make such a difference.

57
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:53,100
- I can't work in your butcher shop.
- Hey! Look, he...

58
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,851
Look,
I'm using trans-sectioned spinal cords

59
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:56,979
to stimulate neurogenesis in
the central nervous system.

60
00:08:56,979 --> 00:08:59,231
My work is at least going to
save thousands for years to come.

61
00:08:59,231 --> 00:09:02,150
In the ER, I get to save one
drunk idiot with a gun.

62
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,486
Yeah, you're right. In the ER,
you're only saving lives.

63
00:09:04,486 --> 00:09:07,239
There's no fame,
there's no CNN interviews...

64
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:09,741
Well, I guess I'll have to stick with Nick.

65
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:12,577
Oh, wait a minute. You're not...
you guys aren't...

66
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:13,671
What?

67
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:17,165
Sleeping together. Sorry,
I thought that was implicit in my disgust.

68
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,041
Explicit, actually.

69
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:21,002
And no, I have a very strict rule
against dating colleagues.

70
00:09:21,002 --> 00:09:22,838
- Oh really?
- I call it the Strange policy.

71
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:25,799
Oh, good! I'm glad something
is named after me.

72
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,759
You know, I invented a
laminectomy procedure,

73
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,096
and yet, somehow, no one seems to want
to call it the Strange technique.

74
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:33,432
- We invented that technique.
- You know, I

75
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:36,101
gotta say, I'm very
flattered by your policy.

76
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:41,189
Look, I'm talking tonight at a
Neurological Society dinner. Come with me.

77
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:45,235
Another speaking engagement? So romantic.

78
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:46,737
You used to love going
to those things with me.

79
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:48,822
- We had fun together.
- No. You've had fun.

80
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:52,325
They weren't about us, they were about you.

81
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:56,538
- Not only about me.
- Stephen. Everything is about you.

82
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:01,585
Maybe we can hyphenate.
Strange-Palmer technique.

83
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:03,420
Palmer-Strange.

84
00:10:51,426 --> 00:10:54,387
Billy! What have you got for me?

85
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,265
I've got a 35-year-old Air Force colonel.
Crushed his lower spine

86
00:10:57,265 --> 00:11:00,352
in some kind of experimental armor.
Mid-thoracic vertebral fracture.

87
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:03,146
Well, I could help, but
so can 50 other people.

88
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:04,981
Find me something worth my time.

89
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:08,902
I have a 68-year-old female
with an advanced brain stem glioma.

90
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:12,322
Yeah, you want me to screw up
my perfect record? Definitely not.

91
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:15,242
How about a 22-year-old
female with an electronic

92
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:18,245
implant in her brain to control
schizophrenia struck by lightning?

93
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,247
That does sound interesting.

94
00:11:21,665 --> 00:11:23,500
Could you send me the... got it.

95
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:28,732
Hey.

96
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:31,943
It's okay.
It's going to be okay.

97
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,168
What did they do?

98
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:54,674
They rushed you in a chopper.
But it took a little while to find you.

99
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:58,344
Golden hours for nerve damage went by
while you were in the car.

100
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,347
What did they do?!?

101
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:06,853
11 stainless steel pins in the bones.

102
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,606
Multiple torn ligaments.

103
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,026
Severe nerve damage
in both hands.

104
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,279
You were on the table for 11 hours.

105
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,448
Look at these fixators.

106
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,535
No one could have done better.

107
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:29,751
I could have done better.

108
00:13:58,196 --> 00:14:02,367
- No. No.
- Give your body time to heal.

109
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:06,162
You ruined me.

110
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,831
How long until I'm...

111
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:11,918
Dr. Strange... those tissues
are still healing.

112
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:16,506
So speed it up. Pass the stent under the
brachial artery under the radial artery.

113
00:14:16,506 --> 00:14:18,174
It's possible.

114
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,611
Experimental and expensive,
but possible.

115
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,363
All I need is possible.

116
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,013
Up.

117
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,182
Up.

118
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,851
Show me your strength.

119
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:03,027
- Ah! It's useless.
- It's not useless, man, you can do this.

120
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,281
Then answer me this, bachelor's degree.

121
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:11,035
Have you ever known anyone
with nerve damage this severe

122
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,704
to do this, and actually recover?

123
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:18,877
One guy, yeah. Factory accident, broke
his back. Paralyzed. His leg wasted away.

124
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,713
He had pain in his shoulder
from the wheelchair.

125
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,048
He came in 3 times a week.

126
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,051
But one day he stopped coming.
I thought he was dead.

127
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,846
A few years later, he
walked past me on the street.

128
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,890
- He walked?
- Yeah, he walked.

129
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,183
Bullshit.
Show me his file.

130
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,020
It can take me a while to pull
the files from the archive.

131
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,023
But if it proves your
arrogant ass wrong,

132
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,691
it's worth it.

133
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,957
I looked at all your research.

134
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:02,211
I read all the papers you've sent,
but... none will work.

135
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:06,049
I... I don't think you realize
how severe the damage is, I...

136
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,134
- Look, here's the thing, I...
- At best, I'd try and fail.

137
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,887
Look, I understand.
Here's the thing. I...

138
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,751
What you want from me is impossible,
Stephen.

139
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:14,015
Come on...

140
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,601
- I've got my own reputation to consider.
- Etienne, wait.

141
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,937
- I can't help you...
- No. No, no, wait!

142
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,944
Hi.

143
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,452
He won't do it.

144
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,289
He's a hack.

145
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:43,127
There's a new procedure in Tokyo.
They culture donor stem cells

146
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,296
and then harvest them
and 3D-print a scaffold.

147
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,215
If I could get a loan
together, just...

148
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,050
- Stephen...
- A small loan, 200,000.

149
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,719
Stephen. You've always spent money
as fast as you could make it

150
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,930
but now you're spending money
you don't even have.

151
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,432
Maybe it's time to
consider stopping.

152
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,353
No. Now is exactly the time not to stop.

153
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,855
Because, you see,
I'm not getting any better!

154
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,109
But this isn't medicine anymore.
This is mania.

155
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,195
Some things just can't be fixed.

156
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,198
- Life without my work...
- Is still life.

157
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:16,452
This isn't the end. There are other things
that can give your life meaning.

158
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,121
Like what? Like you?

159
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,542
And this is the part where you apologize.

160
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,710
This is the part where you leave.

161
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,965
Fine. I can't watch you
do this to yourself anymore.

162
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,801
- Too difficult for you, is it?
- Yes.

163
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,445
It is. And it breaks my
heart to see you this way.

164
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:35,888
No. Don't
pity me.

165
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,474
- I'm not pitying you.
- Oh yeah? Then what are you doing here?

166
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,977
Bringing cheese and wine as if we're
old friends going for a picnic?

167
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,020
We are not friends, Christine.
We were barely lovers.

168
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,941
You just love a sob story, don't you?
Is that what I am to you now?

169
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,610
Poor Stephen Strange, charity case.

170
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,196
He finally needs me. Another dreg
of humanity for you to work on.

171
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,950
Fix him up and send him back into
the world, heart is just humming...

172
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,287
You care so much! Don't you?!?

173
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,543
Goodbye, Stephen.

174
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,204
Told you so!

175
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:52,048
Pangborn, J.
Metropolitan General Hospital

176
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,684
Come on, man! Where is the competition?

177
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,354
You talk a lot!

178
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,360
Jonathan Pangborn,
C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete.

179
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,279
- Who are you?
- Paralyzed from the mid-chest down.

180
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,031
Partial paralysis of both hands.

181
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,032
I don't know you.

182
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:22,370
I'm Stephen Strange. I'm a
neurosurgeon. Was a neurosurgeon.

183
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:25,956
Actually, you know what, man?
I think I know you.

184
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,043
I came to your office once.
You refused to see me.

185
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,795
I never got past your assistant.

186
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,966
- You were untreatable.
- No glory for you in that, right?

187
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:41,097
You came back from a place
there is no way back from!

188
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,269
I... I'm trying to find my own way back.

189
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,274
Hey, Pangborn, you in it or not?

190
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,533
Alright.

191
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,870
I'd given up on my body.

192
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,373
I thought my mind was
the only thing I had

193
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,875
left. I should at least
try to elevate that.

194
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,379
So I sat with gurus, and sacred women.

195
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,632
Strangers carried me to mountain tops
to see holy men.

196
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,635
And finally, I found my teacher.

197
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:24,932
And my mind was elevated.
And my spirit deepened.

198
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,659
And somehow...

199
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,519
- Your body healed.
- Yes.

200
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,857
And there were deeper
secrets to learn then,

201
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,859
but I did not have the strength
to receive them.

202
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,862
I chose to settle for my miracle,
and I came back home.

203
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,703
The place you're looking
for is called Kamar-Taj.

204
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,372
- But the cost is high.
- How much?

205
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,791
I'm not talking about money.

206
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,545
Good luck.

207
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,298
Give me the ball!

208
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,431
Kathmandu, Nepal

209
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,779
Excuse me.
Kamar-Taj?

210
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,449
Do you know where
Kamar-Taj is?

211
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,505
Sign: "Himalayan Healing!
Find Peace! Find Yourself!"

212
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,849
Kamar-Taj?

213
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,685
Kamar-Taj...

214
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,799
Okay.

215
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:28,013
- Guys, I... I don't have any money.
- Your watch.

216
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:33,102
- No, please. It's all I have left.
- Your watch.

217
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,356
Alright.

218
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,440
You're looking
for Kamar-Taj?

219
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,265
Really? Are you sure
you got the right place?

220
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,519
That one looks a little more...
Kamar-y Taj-y.

221
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,274
I once stood in your place.

222
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,778
And I, too, was... disrespectful.

223
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,282
So might I offer you some advice?

224
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,785
Forget everything you think you know.

225
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,290
Uh... alright.

226
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:30,469
The sanctuary of our teacher.
The Ancient One.

227
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,931
The Ancient One?
What's his real name?

228
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,852
Right. Forget everything I
think I know. I'm sorry.

229
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,448
Thank you for... huh!

230
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,370
Okay, that's, uh... a thing...

231
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,205
Thank you.

232
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,040
Hello.

233
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:03,627
Uh, thank you.
And thank you.

234
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:08,548
Uh, thank you, Ancient One...
for... seeing me...

235
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,050
You're very welcome.

236
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,676
The Ancient One.

237
00:25:14,876 --> 00:25:16,682
Thank you, Master Mordo.
Thank you, Master Hamir!

238
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,351
Mr. Strange!

239
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:24,022
- Doctor, actually.
- Well, no. Not anymore, surely.

240
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:28,610
Isn't that why you're here?
You've undergone many procedures.

241
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,112
- Seven, right?
- Yeah...

242
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,782
Good tea.

243
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,207
Did you heal a man named
Pangborn? A paralyzed man.

244
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,544
- In a way.
- You helped him to walk again.

245
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,414
Yes.

246
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:51,133
How do you correct a complete
C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

247
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,552
Oh, I didn't correct it.

248
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,929
He couldn't walk;
I convinced him that he could.

249
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,098
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

250
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,350
When you reattach a
severed nerve, is it you

251
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,269
who heals it back
together or the body?

252
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,188
- It's the cells.
- And the cells are only programmed

253
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,025
to put themselves together
in very specific ways.

254
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,235
That's right.

255
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:11,445
What if I told you that your
own body could be convinced

256
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:15,115
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

257
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,368
You're talking about
cellular regeneration.

258
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,455
That's...
bleeding-edge medical tech.

259
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:24,708
Is that why you're working here,
without a governing medical board?

260
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,960
I mean... just how experimental
is your treatment?

261
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,963
Quite.

262
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:35,302
So, you figured out a way to
reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

263
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,762
No, Mr. Strange.

264
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:42,434
I know how to reorient the spirit
to better heal the body.

265
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,606
Spirit... to heal the body.

266
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,612
Huh. A... Al... Al... alright.
How do we do that? Where do we start?

267
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,452
Don't like that map?

268
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,872
Oh, no. It's... it's very good.
It's just...

269
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,375
you know, I've seen it before.
In gift shops.

270
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,087
And what about this one?

271
00:27:09,287 --> 00:27:12,464
- Acupuncture, great.
- Yeah?

272
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,050
What about... that one?

273
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,886
You're showing me an MRI scan?
I can not believe this.

274
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:22,933
Each of those maps was drawn up by someone
who could see in part, but not the whole.

275
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,852
I spent my last dollar getting here

276
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:29,189
on a one-way ticket, and you're talking
to me about healing through belief?

277
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,942
You're a man who's looking
at the world through a keyhole,

278
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,778
and you spent your whole life
trying to widen that keyhole.

279
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:39,699
To see more, know more. And now,
on hearing that it can be widened

280
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:43,286
in ways you can't imagine,
you reject the possibility?

281
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:46,456
No, I reject it because I do
not believe in fairy tales

282
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,292
about chakras, or energy,
or the power of belief.

283
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,962
There is no such thing as spirit!

284
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:55,298
We are made of matter, and nothing more.

285
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:59,886
We're just another tiny, momentary speck
within an indifferent universe.

286
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:03,682
- You think too little of yourself.
- Oh, you think you see through me, do you?

287
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:08,019
Well, you don't. But I see through you!!!

288
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,997
What did you just do to me?!?

289
00:28:27,197 --> 00:28:29,457
I pushed your astral form
out of your physical form.

290
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,711
What's in that tea? Psilocybin? LSD?

291
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,546
Just tea.

292
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,381
With a little honey.

293
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,825
What just happened?

294
00:28:38,025 --> 00:28:40,468
For a moment,
you entered the astral dimension.

295
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,866
What??

296
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:44,264
A place where the soul
exists apart from the body.

297
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:49,519
- Why are you doing this to me?
- To show you just how much you don't know.

298
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,771
Open your eye.

299
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:58,278
No! No... No! Shit!

300
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:03,366
Oh god! Oh god! Oh god!

301
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,369
This isn't real it isn't real it isn't

302
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,215
His heart rate are getting
dangerously high.

303
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,347
He looks alright to me.

304
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,352
You think you know how the world works?

305
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:35,106
You think that this material
universe is all there is?

306
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,112
What is real?

307
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,367
What mysteries lie beyond
the reach of your senses?

308
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:53,041
At the root of existence,
mind and matter meet.

309
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,045
Thoughts shape reality.

310
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:13,520
This universe is only one
of an infinite number.

311
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,857
Worlds without end.

312
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,611
Some benevolent and life-giving;

313
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,617
Others filled with malice and hunger.

314
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:36,793
Dark places, where powers
older than time lie...

315
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:40,296
ravenous... and waiting.

316
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:53,601
Who are you in this vast multiverse,
Mr. Strange?

317
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,874
Have you seen that before in a gift shop?

318
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,383
Teach me!

319
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,178
No.

320
00:31:29,378 --> 00:31:34,078
<b><i> P s a g m e n o . com </b></i>

321
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,852
No... No!

322
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,354
No, no, no, no no no no!

323
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:44,527
No! Open the door! Please!

324
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,198
Thank you, Masters.

325
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,456
You think I'm wrong to cast him out?

326
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,208
5 hours later, he's still on your doorstep.

327
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,961
There's a strength to him.

328
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:06,883
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition...
I've seen it all before.

329
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,469
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

330
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,346
I can not lead another
gifted student to power,

331
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:14,515
only to lose him to the darkness.

332
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:20,855
You didn't lose me. I wanted
the power to defeat my enemies.

333
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:24,609
You gave me the power
to defeat my demons.

334
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,945
And to live within the natural law.

335
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:30,198
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

336
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,034
We only learn to live above them.

337
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:38,623
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

338
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:42,126
If he deciphers them,
he could bring ruin upon us all.

339
00:32:43,377 --> 00:32:45,296
There may be dark days ahead.

340
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,883
Perhaps Kamar-Taj could
use a man like Strange.

341
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,686
Don't shut me out.

342
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,692
I've nowhere else to go.

343
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,448
Thank you.

344
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,621
Bed.

345
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,040
Rest.

346
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,959
Meditate...

347
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,710
if you can.

348
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,046
The Ancient One will send for you.

349
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,097
Uh, what's this? My mantra?

350
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,601
The Wi-Fi password.

351
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,271
We're not savages.

352
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:08,296
- Time will tell how much I love you.
- Christine

353
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:19,181
The language of the mystic arts
is as old as civilization.

354
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:24,854
The sorcerers of antiquity called
the use of this language "spells".

355
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,357
But if that word offends
your modern sensibilities,

356
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,775
you can call it "program".

357
00:34:30,192 --> 00:34:33,112
The source code that shapes reality.

358
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:36,365
We harness energy

359
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,536
drawn from other dimensions
of the multiverse,

360
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,789
to cast spells,

361
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,877
conjure shields

362
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,046
and weapons

363
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,215
to make magic.

364
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:10,858
But... even if my fingers could do that,

365
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,445
My hands would just be
waving in the air. I mean,

366
00:35:14,528 --> 00:35:16,614
how do I get from here to there?

367
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,116
How did you get to
reattach severed nerves,

368
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:23,037
and put a human spine
back together bone by bone?

369
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,373
Study and practice. Years of it.

370
00:35:33,964 --> 00:35:35,633
Hey.

371
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:41,764
- Mr. Strange.
- Uh... Stephen, please.

372
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,174
And you are?

373
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,850
- Wong.
- Wong.

374
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,771
Just Wong? Like... Adele?

375
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,775
Or... Aristotle.

376
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,612
Drake. Bono.

377
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,200
Eminem.

378
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,205
The book of the invisible sun.

379
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,791
Astronomia Nova.

380
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,876
Codex Imperium.

381
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,962
Key of Solomon.

382
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:17,299
- You finished all of this?
- Yup.

383
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,719
- Come with me.
- Alright.

384
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,848
This section is for Masters only.

385
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,267
But at my discretion,
others may use it.

386
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,270
We should start with Maxim's Primer.

387
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:34,775
How is your Sanskrit?

388
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,862
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

389
00:36:38,612 --> 00:36:41,115
Read it. Classical Sanskrit.

390
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,288
What are those?

391
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,665
The Ancient One's private collection.

392
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,959
So they're forbidden?

393
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:55,546
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is forbidden.
Only certain practices.

394
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:02,136
Those books are far too advanced for
anyone other than the Sorcerer Supreme.

395
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,024
This one's got pages missing.

396
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:19,028
That's the book of Cagliostro.
The study of time.

397
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:22,114
One of the rituals was
stolen by a former Master.

398
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,784
A zealot called Kaecilius.

399
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:29,955
Just after he strung up
the former librarian,

400
00:37:29,955 --> 00:37:32,458
and relieved him of his head.

401
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,379
I'm now the guardian of these books.

402
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:42,593
So if a volume from this collection
should be stolen again, I'd know it.

403
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:46,013
And you'd be dead before
you ever left the compound.

404
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,518
What if it's just overdue? You know?

405
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:55,147
Any... late fees I should know about?
Maybe, perhaps, uhm...

406
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,028
Uh, you know, people used
to think that I was funny.

407
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,529
Did they work for you?

408
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:05,783
Alright. Well, it's been
lovely talking to you, thank

409
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,702
you for the books and for
the horrifying story

410
00:38:08,702 --> 00:38:11,538
and for the threat upon my life.

411
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:45,447
Now we receive the power to destroy
the one who betrayed us.

412
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:50,119
The one who betrays the world.

413
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:53,181
Mastery of the sling ring is
essential to the mystic arts.

414
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,518
They allow us to travel
throughout the multiverse.

415
00:39:56,935 --> 00:39:59,104
All you need to do is focus.

416
00:39:59,354 --> 00:40:01,106
Visualize.

417
00:40:01,106 --> 00:40:03,692
See the destination in your mind.

418
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,362
Look beyond the world in front of you.

419
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,574
Imagine every detail.

420
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:16,121
The clearer the picture,
the quicker, and easier,

421
00:40:16,121 --> 00:40:18,206
the gateway will come.

422
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:23,086
And stop.

423
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:26,298
I'd like a moment alone
with Mr. Strange.

424
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,050
Of course.

425
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,348
- My hands.
- It's not about your hands.

426
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,183
How is this not about my hands?

427
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,934
Master Hamir.

428
00:40:51,698 --> 00:40:53,450
Thank you, Master Hamir.

429
00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:56,703
You cannot beat a river into submission.

430
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:02,042
You have to surrender to its current,
and use its power as your own.

431
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,545
I... I control it by surrendering control?
That doesn't make any sense.

432
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:08,757
Not everything does.
Not everything has to.

433
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:11,885
Your intellect has
taken you far in life.

434
00:41:11,885 --> 00:41:13,595
But it will take you no further.

435
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,430
Surrender, Stephen.

436
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:17,683
Silence your ego

437
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,102
and your power will rise.

438
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,687
Come with me.

439
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:29,903
- Wait. Is this...
- Everest.

440
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,963
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, you're right.

441
00:41:34,163 --> 00:41:38,495
Beautiful.
It's freezing, but... beautiful.

442
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:42,666
At this temperature,
a person can last for 13 minutes

443
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,939
before suffering
permanent loss of function.

444
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:46,211
Great.

445
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:49,614
But you will likely go into
shock within the first 2 minutes.

446
00:41:49,814 --> 00:41:51,216
What?

447
00:41:51,216 --> 00:41:54,219
- Surrender, Stephen.
- No, no!!! Don't!

448
00:42:03,311 --> 00:42:06,356
- How is our new recruit?
- We shall see.

449
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,608
Any second now.

450
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,612
No, not again.

451
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,286
Maybe I should...

452
00:43:32,817 --> 00:43:35,028
- Stephen.
- Wong.

453
00:43:35,153 --> 00:43:38,198
- What do you want, Strange?
- Books on astral projection.

454
00:43:38,698 --> 00:43:41,660
- You're not ready for that.
- Try me, Beyonce.

455
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:48,625
Come on. You've heard of her.
She's a huge star, right?

456
00:43:50,627 --> 00:43:52,462
Do you ever laugh?

457
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,964
Oh come on, just
give me the book, huh?

458
00:43:55,548 --> 00:43:57,300
No.

459
00:44:24,202 --> 00:44:28,915
Once, in this room,
you begged me to let you learn.

460
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:33,211
Now I'm told you question every lesson,
prefering to teach yourself.

461
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:36,131
Once, in this room,
you told me to open my eyes.

462
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,967
Now I'm being told to blindly
accept rules that make no sense.

463
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:42,345
Like the rule against conjuring
a gateway in the library?

464
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:43,618
Wong told on me?

465
00:44:43,818 --> 00:44:45,890
You're advancing quickly
with your sorcery skills.

466
00:44:46,391 --> 00:44:49,102
You need a safe space
to practice your spells.

467
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,622
You are now inside the Mirror Dimension.

468
00:45:09,956 --> 00:45:11,958
Ever present but undetected.

469
00:45:13,126 --> 00:45:15,462
The real world isn't affected
by what happens here.

470
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:19,716
We use the Mirror Dimension
to train, surveil,

471
00:45:20,633 --> 00:45:22,927
and sometimes to contain threats.

472
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,847
You don't want to be stuck
in here without your sling ring.

473
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,850
Hold on. Sorry, what
do you mean, threats?

474
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,528
Learning of an infinite multiverse

475
00:45:40,528 --> 00:45:42,780
included learning of infinite dangers.

476
00:45:42,864 --> 00:45:45,116
And if I told you everything
else that you don't

477
00:45:45,116 --> 00:45:47,285
already know, you'd run
from here in terror.

478
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,627
So, just how ancient is she?

479
00:45:58,129 --> 00:46:00,215
No one knows the age of
the Sorcerer Supreme.

480
00:46:00,965 --> 00:46:04,302
Only that she is Celtic
and never talks about her past.

481
00:46:04,302 --> 00:46:06,095
You follow her even though you don't know?

482
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:08,598
I know that she's steadfast,
but unpredictable.

483
00:46:09,015 --> 00:46:10,683
Merciless, yet kind.

484
00:46:12,018 --> 00:46:13,686
She made me what I am.

485
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:18,942
Trust your teacher.
And don't lose your way.

486
00:46:19,025 --> 00:46:21,611
- Like Kaecilius?
- That's right.

487
00:46:26,866 --> 00:46:28,534
You knew him.

488
00:46:29,035 --> 00:46:32,455
When he first came to us,
he'd lost everyone he ever loved.

489
00:46:32,538 --> 00:46:34,207
He was a grieving and broken man,

490
00:46:34,207 --> 00:46:36,542
searching for answers in the mystic arts.

491
00:46:36,542 --> 00:46:40,046
A brilliant student, but
he was proud, headstrong.

492
00:46:40,129 --> 00:46:42,715
Questioned the Ancient One,
rejected our teaching.

493
00:46:49,931 --> 00:46:51,683
He left Kamar-Taj.

494
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:54,519
His disciples followed him like sheep

495
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:56,771
seduced by false doctrine.

496
00:46:56,771 --> 00:46:59,857
- He stole the forbidden ritual, right?
- Yeah.

497
00:47:00,525 --> 00:47:02,193
What did it do?

498
00:47:03,945 --> 00:47:05,697
No more questions.

499
00:47:06,614 --> 00:47:09,033
- What's that?
- That's a question.

500
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,370
This is a relic.

501
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,957
Some magic is too powerful to sustain,
so we imbue objects with it.

502
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:19,460
Allowing them to take
the strain we can not.

503
00:47:19,627 --> 00:47:24,215
This is the Staff of
the Living Tribunal.

504
00:47:27,802 --> 00:47:29,595
There are many relics.

505
00:47:29,595 --> 00:47:31,264
The Wand of Watoomb.

506
00:47:31,347 --> 00:47:33,099
The Bolting Boots of Voltor.

507
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:37,186
They just roll of the tongue, don't they?
When do I get my relic?

508
00:47:37,186 --> 00:47:39,689
- When you're ready.
- I think I'm ready.

509
00:47:39,772 --> 00:47:42,358
You're ready when the relic
decides you're ready.

510
00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:44,861
For now,

511
00:47:45,778 --> 00:47:47,530
conjure a weapon.

512
00:47:48,114 --> 00:47:50,032
Yeah.

513
00:47:55,955 --> 00:47:59,876
Fight! Fight like
your life depended on it!

514
00:48:05,715 --> 00:48:08,217
Because one day, it may.

515
00:48:28,613 --> 00:48:31,699
Christine

516
00:48:35,786 --> 00:48:40,374
I'm emailing you one more time to

517
00:49:19,038 --> 00:49:20,706
Wong?

518
00:49:32,468 --> 00:49:34,262
Okay.

519
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:37,265
First, open the Eye of Agamotto.

520
00:49:57,702 --> 00:49:59,370
Alright.

521
00:50:22,852 --> 00:50:24,520
Oh my.

522
00:51:01,515 --> 00:51:03,184
Dormammu.

523
00:51:04,685 --> 00:51:06,353
The Dark Dimension.

524
00:51:07,021 --> 00:51:08,689
Eternal life?

525
00:51:14,695 --> 00:51:16,363
Stop!!!

526
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:21,702
Tampering with the continuum
of probability is forbidden!

527
00:51:21,702 --> 00:51:24,038
I... I wa... I was just doing
exactly what it said in the book!

528
00:51:24,038 --> 00:51:27,374
And what did the book say about
the dangers of performing that ritual?

529
00:51:27,374 --> 00:51:29,293
Yeah, I don't know. I hadn't
gotten to that part yet.

530
00:51:29,293 --> 00:51:31,879
Temporal manipulations can
create branches in time.

531
00:51:32,546 --> 00:51:34,298
Unstable dimensional openings.

532
00:51:34,381 --> 00:51:37,218
Spacious paradoxes! Time loops!!!

533
00:51:37,218 --> 00:51:40,596
You want to get stuck reliving the
same moment over, and over, forever,

534
00:51:40,596 --> 00:51:42,264
or never having existed at all?

535
00:51:43,265 --> 00:51:45,351
They really should put the
warnings before that stuff.

536
00:51:45,434 --> 00:51:47,353
Your curiosity could
have gotten you killed.

537
00:51:47,686 --> 00:51:49,939
You weren't manipulating
the space-time continuum,

538
00:51:49,939 --> 00:51:52,024
you were wrecking it.

539
00:51:52,358 --> 00:51:55,861
We do not tamper with
natural law. We defend it.

540
00:51:55,861 --> 00:51:57,530
How did you learn to do that?

541
00:51:58,781 --> 00:52:01,700
Where did you learn the litany of spells
required to even understand it?

542
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,204
I've got a photographic memory. It's how I
got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time.

543
00:52:05,204 --> 00:52:09,208
What you just did
takes more than a good memory.

544
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:10,709
You were born for the mystic arts.

545
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,296
- And yet, my hands still shake.
- For now, yes.

546
00:52:14,296 --> 00:52:16,882
- Not forever?
- We're not prophets.

547
00:52:16,882 --> 00:52:19,051
When do you start telling me what we are?

548
00:52:24,515 --> 00:52:28,435
While heroes like the Avengers
protect the world from physical dangers,

549
00:52:28,852 --> 00:52:31,772
we sorcerers safeguard it
against more mystical threats.

550
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:36,944
The Ancient One is the latest
in a long line of Sorcerers Supreme

551
00:52:36,944 --> 00:52:40,531
Going back thousands of years
to the father of the mystic arts,

552
00:52:40,614 --> 00:52:42,283
the mighty Agamotto.

553
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,121
The same sorcerer who created the eye
you so recklessly borrowed.

554
00:52:48,455 --> 00:52:51,458
Agamotto built 3 Sanctums
in places of power,

555
00:52:51,542 --> 00:52:54,044
where great cities now stand.

556
00:52:54,128 --> 00:52:56,130
That door leads to the Hong Kong Sanctum,

557
00:52:57,548 --> 00:52:59,216
that door to the New York Sanctum.

558
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,760
That one, to the London Sanctum.

559
00:53:02,094 --> 00:53:06,515
Together, the Sanctums generate a
protective shield around our world.

560
00:53:07,433 --> 00:53:10,936
The Sanctums protect the
world, and we sorcerers

561
00:53:11,353 --> 00:53:14,356
- protect the Sanctums.
- From what?

562
00:53:14,356 --> 00:53:17,443
Other-dimensional beings
that threaten our universe.

563
00:53:18,277 --> 00:53:19,945
Like Dormammu?

564
00:53:20,779 --> 00:53:22,448
Where did you learn that name?

565
00:53:23,365 --> 00:53:25,951
I just read it in the book
of Cagliostro. Why?

566
00:53:31,457 --> 00:53:33,125
Dormammu dwells in the Dark Dimension.

567
00:53:34,877 --> 00:53:36,545
Beyond time.

568
00:53:36,962 --> 00:53:41,050
He is the cosmic conquerer,
the destroyer of worlds.

569
00:53:41,467 --> 00:53:44,261
A being of infinite power
and endless hunger,

570
00:53:45,345 --> 00:53:47,347
on a quest to invade every universe

571
00:53:47,347 --> 00:53:50,184
and bring all worlds into
his Dark Dimension.

572
00:53:51,351 --> 00:53:53,687
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

573
00:53:55,189 --> 00:53:57,024
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

574
00:53:57,608 --> 00:54:01,278
A ritual to contact Dormammu and
draw power from the Dark Dimension.

575
00:54:05,532 --> 00:54:07,284
Uuuh... okay. Okay.

576
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,290
I... time-out. I... I came
here to heal my hands,

577
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:17,711
not to fight in some mystical war.

578
00:54:20,047 --> 00:54:21,715
London.

579
00:54:25,052 --> 00:54:26,762
Kaecilius!

580
00:54:26,762 --> 00:54:28,514
No!!!

581
00:54:33,936 --> 00:54:35,687
Wong? Mordo?

582
00:55:12,432 --> 00:55:14,184
177A Bleecker Street

583
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,448
Hello?

584
00:55:57,352 --> 00:55:59,021
Hello?

585
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,520
Daniel. I see they made you
Master of the Sanctum.

586
00:56:41,772 --> 00:56:43,523
Do you know what that means?

587
00:56:44,357 --> 00:56:46,026
That you'll die protecting it.

588
00:57:02,292 --> 00:57:03,960
Stop!

589
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:16,932
How long have you been
at Kamar-TaJ, Mister...?

590
00:57:17,182 --> 00:57:18,934
Doctor.

591
00:57:19,768 --> 00:57:22,938
- Just Doctor?
- It's Strange.

592
00:57:24,356 --> 00:57:27,275
Maybe. Who am
I to judge?

593
00:59:52,045 --> 00:59:53,963
You don't know how to use that, do you?

594
01:01:39,193 --> 01:01:40,945
What?

595
01:01:44,282 --> 01:01:46,784
- You'll die here.
- Oh, stop it.

596
01:01:47,118 --> 01:01:48,286
I said, stop it!

597
01:01:48,369 --> 01:01:49,779
You cannot stop this,
Mr. Doctor.

598
01:01:49,979 --> 01:01:51,789
Why... look, I don't
even know what "this" is.

599
01:01:52,457 --> 01:01:55,460
It's the end and the beginning.

600
01:01:55,543 --> 01:01:58,129
The many becoming the few,
becoming the One.

601
01:01:59,881 --> 01:02:01,549
Look, if you're not going
to start making sense,

602
01:02:01,549 --> 01:02:03,217
I'm just going to have to
put this thing back on.

603
01:02:03,217 --> 01:02:04,427
Tell me, Mr. Doctor.

604
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:07,680
Alright, look. My name
is Dr. Stephen Strange.

605
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,965
You are a doctor?

606
01:02:09,165 --> 01:02:10,850
- Yes.
- A scientist.

607
01:02:11,517 --> 01:02:16,439
You understand the laws of nature.
All things age. All things die.

608
01:02:16,606 --> 01:02:20,109
In the end, our sun burns out,
our universe grows cold and perishes.

609
01:02:21,027 --> 01:02:22,779
But the Dark Dimension...

610
01:02:23,196 --> 01:02:24,947
it's a place beyond time.

611
01:02:24,947 --> 01:02:28,368
That's it. I'm putting this thing back on.
This world doesn't have to die, Doctor.

612
01:02:28,451 --> 01:02:31,371
This world can take its rightful
place among so many others,

613
01:02:31,371 --> 01:02:33,122
as part of the One.

614
01:02:33,373 --> 01:02:35,041
The great and beautiful One.

615
01:02:36,042 --> 01:02:37,710
And we can all live forever.

616
01:02:38,044 --> 01:02:39,712
Really?

617
01:02:41,464 --> 01:02:44,801
What do you have to gain out of
this New Age dimensional utopia?

618
01:02:45,676 --> 01:02:49,263
The same as you. The same as
everyone. Life. Eternal life.

619
01:02:50,348 --> 01:02:52,350
People think in terms of good and evil,

620
01:02:52,433 --> 01:02:55,770
but really, time is the true enemy
of us all. Time kills everything.

621
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:57,688
What about the people you killed?

622
01:02:57,688 --> 01:03:01,776
Tiny, momentary specks within
an indifferent universe.

623
01:03:03,778 --> 01:03:05,446
Yes. You see,

624
01:03:06,447 --> 01:03:08,282
you see what we're doing?

625
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:13,037
The world is not what it ought to be.
Humanity longs for the eternal,

626
01:03:13,454 --> 01:03:15,873
for a world beyond time, because
time is what enslaves us.

627
01:03:15,957 --> 01:03:18,042
Time is an insult.

628
01:03:18,709 --> 01:03:20,545
Death is an insult.

629
01:03:21,629 --> 01:03:23,297
Doctor...

630
01:03:23,881 --> 01:03:26,050
We don't seek to rule this world.

631
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:29,011
We seek to save it, to
hand it over to Dormammu,

632
01:03:29,011 --> 01:03:31,597
who is the intent of all evolution,

633
01:03:32,348 --> 01:03:34,100
the Why of all existence.

634
01:03:35,101 --> 01:03:37,854
The Sorcerer Supreme defends existence.

635
01:03:39,438 --> 01:03:41,782
What was it that brought
you to Kamar-Taj, Doctor?

636
01:03:41,982 --> 01:03:43,526
Was it enlightenment?

637
01:03:44,193 --> 01:03:45,945
Power?

638
01:03:47,196 --> 01:03:49,532
You came to be healed, as did we all.

639
01:03:51,534 --> 01:03:54,203
Kamar-Taj is a place that
collects broken things.

640
01:03:54,203 --> 01:03:56,038
We all come with the
promise of being healed,

641
01:03:56,038 --> 01:03:58,791
but instead, the Ancient One
gives us parlor tricks.

642
01:04:00,376 --> 01:04:02,461
The real magic she
keeps for herself.

643
01:04:02,545 --> 01:04:05,882
Have you ever wondered how she
managed to live this long?

644
01:04:10,428 --> 01:04:13,598
I... I saw the rituals in
the book of Cagliostro.

645
01:04:13,598 --> 01:04:16,183
So, you know.

646
01:04:16,267 --> 01:04:21,355
The ritual gives me the power to overthrow
the Ancient One and tear her Sanctums down,

647
01:04:21,439 --> 01:04:23,858
to let the Dark Dimension in.

648
01:04:24,442 --> 01:04:27,778
Because what the Ancient One
hoards, Dormammu gives freely.

649
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:30,698
Life, everlasting.

650
01:04:31,365 --> 01:04:34,619
He is not the destroyer of worlds,
Doctor, he is the savior of worlds.

651
01:04:36,537 --> 01:04:39,373
No. I mean, come on.
Look at your face.

652
01:04:40,124 --> 01:04:42,293
Dormammu made you a murderer.

653
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:44,962
Just how good can his kingdom be?

654
01:04:46,797 --> 01:04:48,466
You think that's funny?

655
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,468
No. No, Doctor.

656
01:04:50,551 --> 01:04:53,179
What's funny is that you've
lost your sling ring.

657
01:06:01,372 --> 01:06:03,874
- Sir, can I help you?
- Dr. Palmer, where is she?

658
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:05,518
- Sir, we need to...
- Where is she?

659
01:06:05,718 --> 01:06:06,877
At the nurses station.

660
01:06:07,044 --> 01:06:08,712
Christine!

661
01:06:10,297 --> 01:06:12,883
- Stephen? Oh my god. What...
- We need to get

662
01:06:12,883 --> 01:06:15,261
me on an operation table now.
Just you.

663
01:06:15,428 --> 01:06:17,179
Now! I don't have any time!

664
01:06:17,513 --> 01:06:21,016
- What happened?
- Stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.

665
01:06:22,351 --> 01:06:24,103
What are you wearing?

666
01:06:30,276 --> 01:06:35,030
- The chest cavity is clear.
- The blood... is in the pericardial sac.

667
01:06:37,116 --> 01:06:39,368
No. No no no no no no no!
Stephen! Stephen!

668
01:07:08,022 --> 01:07:09,690
Just a little higher.

669
01:07:11,275 --> 01:07:13,027
Please be careful with the needle.

670
01:07:14,862 --> 01:07:16,530
Stephen?

671
01:07:17,531 --> 01:07:21,285
- Oh lord, oh lord. What am I seeing?
- My astral body.

672
01:07:22,786 --> 01:07:25,623
- Are you dead?
- No, Christine, but I am dying.

673
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:30,127
Right. Right.

674
01:07:31,462 --> 01:07:34,798
Yeah. Alright.

675
01:07:44,016 --> 01:07:45,935
I've... I've never seen
a wound like this before.

676
01:07:46,185 --> 01:07:47,937
What were you stabbed with?

677
01:07:48,354 --> 01:07:50,022
I don't know.

678
01:08:09,124 --> 01:08:11,794
- I'm going to have to vanish now.
- No, I...

679
01:08:12,378 --> 01:08:14,046
Keep me alive, will you?

680
01:08:17,132 --> 01:08:19,051
Okay! Okay.

681
01:08:43,701 --> 01:08:45,452
Oh shit!

682
01:09:15,774 --> 01:09:17,443
Charging to 200 Joule

683
01:09:28,537 --> 01:09:30,205
Stephen, come on.

684
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:35,544
- Hit me again!
- Stop doing that!

685
01:09:35,627 --> 01:09:37,463
Up the voltage and hit me again.

686
01:09:37,463 --> 01:09:39,798
- No, your heart is beating!
- Just do it!

687
01:10:11,622 --> 01:10:13,373
Oh god!

688
01:10:13,457 --> 01:10:15,209
- Are you ok?
- Hey there.

689
01:10:16,627 --> 01:10:18,378
Okay.

690
01:10:23,634 --> 01:10:27,346
After all this time,
you just show up here,

691
01:10:29,181 --> 01:10:32,768
- flying out of your body?
- Yeah, I know.

692
01:10:33,435 --> 01:10:35,187
I missed you too, by the way.

693
01:10:36,855 --> 01:10:39,358
I wrote 2 emails, but
you never responded.

694
01:10:39,358 --> 01:10:41,026
Why would I?

695
01:10:41,944 --> 01:10:43,946
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

696
01:10:45,197 --> 01:10:46,949
For all of it.
And you were right,

697
01:10:46,949 --> 01:10:50,786
I was a complete asshole.
I treated you so horribly

698
01:10:50,786 --> 01:10:54,957
- and you deserved so much more.
- Stop. You... you're clearly in shock.

699
01:10:56,792 --> 01:10:58,460
I mean, what the hell is happening?

700
01:10:59,378 --> 01:11:01,129
Where have you been?

701
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:04,549
Well, after Western medicine failed me,

702
01:11:04,633 --> 01:11:07,552
I headed East, and I
ended up in Kathmandu.

703
01:11:07,552 --> 01:11:10,097
- Kathmandu?
- Yeah.

704
01:11:11,223 --> 01:11:15,185
- What, like the Bob Seger song?
- 1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. And then,

705
01:11:15,185 --> 01:11:16,937
I went to a place called Kamar-Taj

706
01:11:16,937 --> 01:11:22,359
and I talked to someone
called the Ancient One, and...

707
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:26,863
- Oh. So you joined a cult.
- No, I didn't. Not exactly. I mean,

708
01:11:26,863 --> 01:11:29,992
they did teach me to tap into powers
that I never even knew existed.

709
01:11:29,992 --> 01:11:32,285
- Yeah, that sounds like a cult.
- It's not a cult.

710
01:11:32,577 --> 01:11:35,622
- Well, that's what a cultist would say.
- Oh, no.

711
01:11:36,206 --> 01:11:38,625
Wait, Stephen... what do
you think you're doing?

712
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:40,377
I'm late for a cult meeting.

713
01:11:44,464 --> 01:11:46,299
- This is insane.
- Yeah.

714
01:11:46,299 --> 01:11:48,343
Where are you going?

715
01:11:48,802 --> 01:11:50,429
- Uhm...
- Just tell me the truth?

716
01:11:50,512 --> 01:11:54,599
Well, a powerful sorcerer, who gave
himself over to an ancient entity

717
01:11:54,599 --> 01:11:57,269
who can bend the very laws of physics,
tried very hard to kill me,

718
01:11:57,269 --> 01:11:59,229
but I left him chained up
in Greenwich Village,

719
01:11:59,229 --> 01:12:01,356
and the quickest way back there
is through a dimensional gateway

720
01:12:01,356 --> 01:12:05,485
- that I opened up in the mop closet.
- Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

721
01:12:15,954 --> 01:12:17,998
I really do have to go.

722
01:13:05,295 --> 01:13:07,005
Strange!

723
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:12,802
- You're okay.
- A relative term, but yeah, I'm okay.

724
01:13:13,678 --> 01:13:15,347
The Cloak of Levitation.

725
01:13:16,348 --> 01:13:18,016
It came to you.

726
01:13:18,517 --> 01:13:20,185
No minor feat.

727
01:13:20,852 --> 01:13:22,604
It's a fickle thing.

728
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,551
He's escaped.

729
01:13:23,751 --> 01:13:24,814
- Kaecilius?
- Yeah.

730
01:13:26,107 --> 01:13:28,610
He can fold space and matter at will.

731
01:13:29,027 --> 01:13:32,388
He folds matter outside the mirror
dimension? In the real world?

732
01:13:32,588 --> 01:13:33,949
Yeah.

733
01:13:34,532 --> 01:13:36,284
- How many more?
- Two.

734
01:13:37,452 --> 01:13:40,025
I stranded one in the desert.
- And the other?

735
01:13:40,225 --> 01:13:41,998
His body was in the hall.

736
01:13:41,998 --> 01:13:45,794
- Master Drumm was in the foyer.
- He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

737
01:13:45,794 --> 01:13:47,462
The London Sanctum has fallen.

738
01:13:48,129 --> 01:13:52,300
Only New York and Hong Kong remain now
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

739
01:13:53,343 --> 01:13:55,595
You defended the New York
Sanctum from attack.

740
01:13:55,929 --> 01:13:58,098
With its Master gone, it needs another,

741
01:13:58,181 --> 01:14:00,183
Master Strange.

742
01:14:02,602 --> 01:14:04,354
No.

743
01:14:04,771 --> 01:14:06,690
It is Dr. Strange.

744
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:09,025
Not Master Strange, not Mr. Strange,

745
01:14:09,025 --> 01:14:10,944
Doctor Strange.

746
01:14:12,237 --> 01:14:15,615
When I became a doctor,
I swore an oath to do no harm.

747
01:14:15,615 --> 01:14:18,702
And I have just killed a man!
I'm not doing that again.

748
01:14:18,702 --> 01:14:21,371
I became a doctor to save
lives, not take them.

749
01:14:21,371 --> 01:14:25,542
You become a doctor to save
one life above all others.

750
01:14:25,542 --> 01:14:27,377
Your own.

751
01:14:27,419 --> 01:14:31,131
- Still seeing through me, are you?
- I see what I've always seen.

752
01:14:31,214 --> 01:14:33,383
Your overinflated ego.

753
01:14:33,883 --> 01:14:36,594
You want to go back to the delusion
that you can control anything,

754
01:14:37,178 --> 01:14:40,181
even death, which no one can control.

755
01:14:40,181 --> 01:14:42,851
Not even the great doctor
Stephen Strange.

756
01:14:43,268 --> 01:14:45,520
Not even Dormammu?

757
01:14:46,938 --> 01:14:48,606
He offers immortality.

758
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:50,900
It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.

759
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:54,279
- He feeds off it.
- Like you feed on him?

760
01:14:54,279 --> 01:14:57,741
You talk to me about controlling death.
Well, I know how you do it.

761
01:14:57,741 --> 01:15:00,785
I've seen the missing rituals
from the book of Cagliostro.

762
01:15:01,828 --> 01:15:04,998
Measure your next words
very carefully, doctor.

763
01:15:04,998 --> 01:15:06,875
Because you might not like them?

764
01:15:06,875 --> 01:15:09,627
Because you may not know
of what you speak.

765
01:15:09,669 --> 01:15:12,380
- What is he talking about?
- I'm talking about her long life.

766
01:15:12,464 --> 01:15:14,382
The source of her immortality.

767
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,637
She draws power from the
Dark Dimension to stay alive.

768
01:15:21,848 --> 01:15:23,100
That's not true.

769
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,351
I've seen the rituals
and worked them out.

770
01:15:26,269 --> 01:15:27,979
I know how you do it.

771
01:15:29,355 --> 01:15:32,192
Once they regroup,
the zealots will be back.

772
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:35,028
You'll need reinforcements.

773
01:15:42,577 --> 01:15:46,247
- She is not who you think she is.
- You don't have the right to say that.

774
01:15:46,289 --> 01:15:48,541
You have no idea of the
responsibility that rests

775
01:15:48,625 --> 01:15:50,960
- upon her shoulders.
- No, and I don't want to know.

776
01:15:51,377 --> 01:15:53,505
- You're a coward.
- Because I'm not a killer?

777
01:15:53,505 --> 01:15:55,465
These zealots will
snuff us all out,

778
01:15:55,715 --> 01:15:58,593
and you can muster the strength
to snuff them out first?

779
01:15:58,593 --> 01:16:01,513
- What do you think I just did?
- You saved your own life!

780
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:04,599
And then whined about
it like a wounded dog.

781
01:16:04,599 --> 01:16:06,601
When you would have
done it so easily?

782
01:16:06,601 --> 01:16:09,604
You have no idea.
The things I've done...

783
01:16:11,272 --> 01:16:13,024
And the answer is yes.

784
01:16:13,525 --> 01:16:16,528
- Without hesitation.
- Even if there's another way?

785
01:16:16,611 --> 01:16:20,031
- There is no other way.
- You lack imagination.

786
01:16:20,031 --> 01:16:24,953
No, Stephen. You lack a spine.

787
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:31,709
They're back.

788
01:16:38,049 --> 01:16:40,051
We have to end this. Now!

789
01:16:45,932 --> 01:16:48,518
Strange! Get down here and fight!

790
01:16:54,774 --> 01:16:56,442
The Mirror Dimension.

791
01:16:56,693 --> 01:16:58,820
You can't affect the
real world in here.

792
01:16:59,445 --> 01:17:02,282
Who's laughing now, asshole?

793
01:17:04,492 --> 01:17:06,202
I am.

794
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:21,592
They've got no sling ring. I mean,
they can't escape, right?

795
01:17:23,011 --> 01:17:24,679
Run!

796
01:17:40,862 --> 01:17:42,697
Their connection to the
Dark Dimension makes

797
01:17:42,697 --> 01:17:44,532
them more powerful in
the Mirror Dimension.

798
01:17:44,532 --> 01:17:47,535
They can't affect the real world,
but they can still kill us.

799
01:17:47,535 --> 01:17:49,871
This wasn't clever. This was suicide!

800
01:18:06,637 --> 01:18:08,347
That is hilarious.

801
01:18:55,019 --> 01:18:56,729
This was a mistake.

802
01:20:29,196 --> 01:20:30,865
It's true.

803
01:20:31,741 --> 01:20:34,243
She does draw power from
the Dark Dimension.

804
01:20:38,205 --> 01:20:40,041
Kaecilius.

805
01:20:42,126 --> 01:20:45,212
I came to you, broken,

806
01:20:45,379 --> 01:20:47,548
lost, bleeding.

807
01:20:47,631 --> 01:20:51,260
I trusted you to be my teacher,
and you fed me lies.

808
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:52,679
I tried to protect you.

809
01:20:52,879 --> 01:20:55,097
- From the truth?
- From yourself.

810
01:20:55,097 --> 01:20:59,602
- I have a new teacher now.
- Dormammu deceives you.

811
01:21:00,269 --> 01:21:02,521
You have no idea of what he truly is.

812
01:21:02,605 --> 01:21:06,208
His eternal life is not paradise,
but torment.

813
01:21:06,408 --> 01:21:07,610
Liar.

814
01:22:04,041 --> 01:22:07,795
- Christine!!!
- Are you kidding me?

815
01:22:08,963 --> 01:22:10,631
Oh my god.

816
01:22:12,216 --> 01:22:14,009
No fibrillation...

817
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:16,262
- It's neurogenic?
- Yes.

818
01:22:24,854 --> 01:22:26,522
Nick?

819
01:22:28,566 --> 01:22:30,442
We need to relieve the
pressure on her brain.

820
01:22:33,612 --> 01:22:35,548
- She still drops.
- We're losing her!

821
01:22:35,748 --> 01:22:37,283
You need to
increase her oxygen!

822
01:22:37,366 --> 01:22:40,369
- I need a crash cart!
- Her pupils are dilated!

823
01:22:40,536 --> 01:22:44,123
No reflexes.
I'm not reading any brain activity.

824
01:22:54,883 --> 01:22:56,594
What are you doing?

825
01:22:57,177 --> 01:22:58,887
You're dying!

826
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:10,399
You have to return to your body now.
You don't have time.

827
01:23:10,441 --> 01:23:14,361
Time is relative. Your body
hasn't even hit the floor yet.

828
01:23:16,447 --> 01:23:19,617
I've spent so many years
peering through time,

829
01:23:20,117 --> 01:23:22,119
looking at this exact moment.

830
01:23:22,453 --> 01:23:24,413
But I can't see past it.

831
01:23:24,622 --> 01:23:28,042
I've prevented countless terrible futures.

832
01:23:28,042 --> 01:23:30,544
And after each one, there's always another.

833
01:23:31,128 --> 01:23:33,130
And they all lead here,

834
01:23:33,797 --> 01:23:36,550
- but never further.
- You think this is where you die.

835
01:23:37,676 --> 01:23:41,096
- Do you wonder what I see in your future?
- No.

836
01:23:43,349 --> 01:23:46,226
- Yes.
- I never saw your future.

837
01:23:46,426 --> 01:23:48,103
Only its possibilities.

838
01:23:48,979 --> 01:23:52,066
You have such a capacity for goodness.

839
01:23:52,107 --> 01:23:54,026
You always excelled,

840
01:23:54,026 --> 01:23:56,236
but not because you crave success,

841
01:23:56,236 --> 01:23:58,530
but because of your fear of failure.

842
01:23:58,947 --> 01:24:00,949
It's what made me a great doctor.

843
01:24:00,949 --> 01:24:03,786
It's precisely what kept
you from greatness.

844
01:24:04,661 --> 01:24:06,955
Arrogance and fear still keep you

845
01:24:07,039 --> 01:24:10,042
from learning the simplest and
most significant lesson of all.

846
01:24:10,542 --> 01:24:12,211
Which is?

847
01:24:13,629 --> 01:24:15,297
It's not about you.

848
01:24:19,593 --> 01:24:21,345
When you first came to me,

849
01:24:21,345 --> 01:24:24,264
you asked me how I was able
to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

850
01:24:25,182 --> 01:24:26,934
I didn't.

851
01:24:28,435 --> 01:24:32,022
He channels dimensional energy
directly into his own body.

852
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:35,692
- He uses magic to walk.
- Constantly.

853
01:24:36,443 --> 01:24:38,070
He had a choice,

854
01:24:39,071 --> 01:24:40,864
to return to to his own life

855
01:24:41,698 --> 01:24:43,742
or to serve something greater than himself.

856
01:24:43,742 --> 01:24:46,203
So, I could have my hands back again?

857
01:24:46,703 --> 01:24:48,455
My old life?

858
01:24:48,914 --> 01:24:50,582
You could.

859
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:54,044
And the world would be
all the lesser for it.

860
01:24:55,462 --> 01:24:58,340
I've hated drawing power
from the Dark Dimension.

861
01:24:58,882 --> 01:25:02,344
But as you well know, sometimes one
must break the rules

862
01:25:02,344 --> 01:25:06,181
- in order to serve the greater good.
- Mordo won't see it that way.

863
01:25:06,682 --> 01:25:09,351
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable,

864
01:25:09,351 --> 01:25:11,436
forged by the fires of his youth.

865
01:25:12,271 --> 01:25:15,357
He needs your flexibility,
just as you need his strength.

866
01:25:16,775 --> 01:25:20,445
Only together do you stand a
chance of stopping Dormammu.

867
01:25:20,863 --> 01:25:22,614
I'm not ready.

868
01:25:24,366 --> 01:25:26,034
No one ever is.

869
01:25:27,286 --> 01:25:29,955
We don't get to choose our time.

870
01:25:33,542 --> 01:25:35,460
Death is what gives life meaning.

871
01:25:37,212 --> 01:25:39,214
To know your days are numbered,

872
01:25:39,882 --> 01:25:41,550
your time is short.

873
01:25:43,677 --> 01:25:46,597
You'd think after all
this time I'd be ready.

874
01:25:46,889 --> 01:25:48,682
But look at me,

875
01:25:48,682 --> 01:25:51,351
stretching one moment out into a thousand,

876
01:25:52,144 --> 01:25:54,104
just so I can watch the snow.

877
01:26:33,101 --> 01:26:34,853
Are you okay?

878
01:26:42,361 --> 01:26:44,946
- I don't understand what's happening.
- I know.

879
01:26:46,698 --> 01:26:49,201
But I have to go right now.

880
01:26:54,247 --> 01:26:56,792
You said that losing my hands
didn't have to be the end,

881
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:59,544
- that it could be a beginning.
- Yeah.

882
01:27:01,546 --> 01:27:04,091
Because there are other ways to save lives.

883
01:27:07,594 --> 01:27:09,346
A harder way.

884
01:27:11,598 --> 01:27:13,266
A weirder way.

885
01:27:13,433 --> 01:27:16,937
Dr. Palmer, the ER, please.
Dr. Palmer, the ER.

886
01:27:21,608 --> 01:27:23,276
I don't want to let you go.

887
01:28:11,533 --> 01:28:13,285
Stop.

888
01:28:17,747 --> 01:28:21,042
Hong Kong

889
01:28:42,522 --> 01:28:44,190
Choose your weapon wisely.

890
01:28:47,777 --> 01:28:49,446
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

891
01:28:52,198 --> 01:28:53,950
No one.

892
01:29:09,215 --> 01:29:10,372
Kaecilius.

893
01:29:10,572 --> 01:29:12,928
You're on the wrong side of history,
Wong.

894
01:29:25,774 --> 01:29:29,027
- She's dead.
- You were right.

895
01:29:29,944 --> 01:29:32,364
She wasn't who I thought she was.

896
01:29:32,864 --> 01:29:34,532
She was complicated.

897
01:29:39,537 --> 01:29:41,206
Complicated?

898
01:29:44,042 --> 01:29:45,877
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

899
01:29:46,461 --> 01:29:48,213
Dangerous.

900
01:29:48,546 --> 01:29:50,298
What if it overtook her?

901
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,843
She taught us it was forbidden,

902
01:29:55,011 --> 01:29:58,765
while she drew on its power
to steal centuries of life.

903
01:29:58,765 --> 01:30:00,934
She did what she thought was right.

904
01:30:00,934 --> 01:30:02,644
The bill comes due.

905
01:30:03,687 --> 01:30:05,438
Don't you see?

906
01:30:07,190 --> 01:30:09,693
Her transgressions led
the zealots to Dormammu.

907
01:30:09,693 --> 01:30:13,697
Kaecilius was her fault.

908
01:30:14,155 --> 01:30:17,283
And here we are, in the
consequence of her deception.

909
01:30:21,037 --> 01:30:24,499
- A world on fire.
- Mordo, London Sanctum has fallen.

910
01:30:24,541 --> 01:30:28,378
And New York has been attacked. Twice.
You know where they're going next.

911
01:30:28,962 --> 01:30:30,197
Hong Kong.

912
01:30:30,397 --> 01:30:32,632
You told me once to fight
as if my life depended on it,

913
01:30:32,632 --> 01:30:35,510
because one day, it might.
Well, today is that day.

914
01:30:36,052 --> 01:30:38,138
I can not defeat them alone.

915
01:30:56,114 --> 01:30:57,782
The Sanctum has already fallen.

916
01:31:05,707 --> 01:31:07,375
The Dark Dimension.

917
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,628
Dormammu is coming.

918
01:31:12,797 --> 01:31:14,549
It's too late.

919
01:31:14,549 --> 01:31:16,259
Nothing can stop him.

920
01:31:18,178 --> 01:31:19,929
Not necessarily.

921
01:31:23,683 --> 01:31:25,351
No.

922
01:32:06,434 --> 01:32:08,102
Spells working.

923
01:32:09,270 --> 01:32:11,022
We got a second chance.

924
01:33:49,954 --> 01:33:52,290
No!

925
01:34:01,799 --> 01:34:03,676
Wong!

926
01:34:11,851 --> 01:34:13,519
I'm breaking the laws of nature, I know.

927
01:34:16,022 --> 01:34:17,690
Well, don't stop now.

928
01:34:19,108 --> 01:34:22,361
When the Sanctum is restored, they will
attack again. We have to defend it.

929
01:34:22,361 --> 01:34:24,780
Come on!

930
01:34:52,433 --> 01:34:55,603
Get up, Strange. Get up and fight!

931
01:34:55,686 --> 01:34:57,355
We will finish this.

932
01:34:58,272 --> 01:35:00,191
You can't fight the inevitable.

933
01:35:03,611 --> 01:35:05,363
Isn't it beautiful?

934
01:35:06,864 --> 01:35:08,866
A world beyond time.

935
01:35:11,869 --> 01:35:13,537
Beyond death.

936
01:35:17,375 --> 01:35:19,043
Beyond time...

937
01:35:19,377 --> 01:35:21,045
Strange!

938
01:35:52,785 --> 01:35:54,453
He's gone.

939
01:35:55,454 --> 01:35:58,374
Stephen Strange has left
to surrender to his power.

940
01:36:30,698 --> 01:36:33,451
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

941
01:36:33,534 --> 01:36:36,370
You've come to die.

942
01:36:36,370 --> 01:36:43,377
Your world is now my
world, like all worlds.

943
01:37:13,532 --> 01:37:16,535
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

944
01:37:17,203 --> 01:37:19,538
You've come to die.

945
01:37:20,206 --> 01:37:23,542
Your world is now my world...

946
01:37:24,376 --> 01:37:26,045
What is this?

947
01:37:26,212 --> 01:37:28,639
- Illusion?
- No, this is real.

948
01:37:28,839 --> 01:37:30,466
Good.

949
01:37:40,935 --> 01:37:43,771
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

950
01:37:44,271 --> 01:37:47,107
You... what is happening?

951
01:37:47,858 --> 01:37:50,444
Just as you gave Kaecilius
powers from your dimension,

952
01:37:50,778 --> 01:37:52,947
I've brought a little power from mine.

953
01:37:53,531 --> 01:37:55,699
This is time.

954
01:37:56,283 --> 01:37:59,536
An endless looped time.

955
01:38:00,037 --> 01:38:02,623
You dare!

956
01:38:05,876 --> 01:38:07,628
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

957
01:38:08,879 --> 01:38:11,215
You cannot do this forever.

958
01:38:11,548 --> 01:38:13,342
Actually, I can.

959
01:38:13,425 --> 01:38:15,094
This is how things are now.

960
01:38:15,844 --> 01:38:20,015
You and me, trapped in
this moment, endlessly.

961
01:38:20,349 --> 01:38:23,602
Then you will spend eternity dying.

962
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:27,773
Yeah. But everyone on Earth will live.

963
01:38:28,107 --> 01:38:29,858
But you will suffer.

964
01:38:30,025 --> 01:38:31,777
Pain is an old friend.

965
01:38:34,613 --> 01:38:36,282
Dormammu!

966
01:38:36,448 --> 01:38:39,034
- I've come to bargain.
- End this!

967
01:38:39,201 --> 01:38:42,121
Dormammu!... Dormammu!...
Dormammu!...

968
01:38:57,594 --> 01:39:00,264
You will never win.

969
01:39:01,849 --> 01:39:03,517
No...

970
01:39:03,767 --> 01:39:05,436
But I can lose.

971
01:39:05,936 --> 01:39:12,943
Again, and again, and again,
and again, forever.

972
01:39:14,611 --> 01:39:17,448
- And that makes you my prisoner.
- No.

973
01:39:17,531 --> 01:39:21,952
Stop! Make this stop!!!

974
01:39:22,453 --> 01:39:25,956
- Set me free!
- No.

975
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:28,542
I've come to bargain.

976
01:39:30,377 --> 01:39:33,130
Oh, what do you want?

977
01:39:34,381 --> 01:39:36,592
Take your zealots from the Earth.

978
01:39:37,176 --> 01:39:39,178
End your assault on my world.

979
01:39:39,678 --> 01:39:41,597
Never come back.

980
01:39:42,014 --> 01:39:45,100
Do it, and I'll break the loop.

981
01:39:54,777 --> 01:39:56,445
Get up, Strange.

982
01:39:56,528 --> 01:39:58,197
Get up and fight!

983
01:39:58,530 --> 01:40:00,282
We will finish this.

984
01:40:00,783 --> 01:40:02,534
Isn't it beautiful?

985
01:40:04,036 --> 01:40:06,121
A world beyond time.

986
01:40:08,874 --> 01:40:10,542
Beyond death.

987
01:40:22,513 --> 01:40:25,015
- What have you done?
- I made a bargain.

988
01:40:28,769 --> 01:40:31,155
- What is this?
- Well, it's, uh...

989
01:40:31,355 --> 01:40:32,940
it's everything you ever wanted.

990
01:40:34,274 --> 01:40:36,610
Eternal life as part of the One.

991
01:40:39,363 --> 01:40:41,281
You're not going to like it.

992
01:41:00,425 --> 01:41:03,345
I think he really should have
stolen the whole book,

993
01:41:03,345 --> 01:41:05,013
because the warnings...

994
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:08,100
the warnings come after the spells.

995
01:41:17,359 --> 01:41:19,528
Oh, that's funny.

996
01:41:46,096 --> 01:41:47,764
We did it.

997
01:41:50,183 --> 01:41:51,935
Yes.

998
01:41:52,102 --> 01:41:53,854
Yes, we did it.

999
01:41:54,855 --> 01:41:58,191
By also violating the natural laws.

1000
01:41:59,026 --> 01:42:01,028
Look around you. It's over.

1001
01:42:01,611 --> 01:42:04,448
You still think there will be
no consequences, Strange?

1002
01:42:05,782 --> 01:42:07,534
No price to pay?

1003
01:42:08,118 --> 01:42:11,204
We broke our rules, just like her.

1004
01:42:12,122 --> 01:42:15,876
The bill comes due.

1005
01:42:16,626 --> 01:42:18,295
Always.

1006
01:42:18,545 --> 01:42:21,882
A reckoning.

1007
01:42:23,091 --> 01:42:25,844
I will follow this path no longer.

1008
01:42:59,795 --> 01:43:01,463
Yeah, it's okay.

1009
01:43:10,597 --> 01:43:12,265
Wise choice.

1010
01:43:12,682 --> 01:43:16,603
You'll wear the eye of Agamotto
once you've mastered its powers.

1011
01:43:17,103 --> 01:43:18,855
Until then,

1012
01:43:19,189 --> 01:43:22,442
best not to walk the streets
wearing an infinity stone.

1013
01:43:22,692 --> 01:43:23,953
A what?

1014
01:43:24,153 --> 01:43:26,613
You have a gift for the mystic arts,
but you still have much to learn.

1015
01:43:29,866 --> 01:43:33,286
Word of the Ancient One's death
will spread through the multiverse.

1016
01:43:33,703 --> 01:43:36,623
The Earth has no Sorcerer
Supreme to defend it.

1017
01:43:36,957 --> 01:43:39,125
- We must be ready.
- We'll be ready.

1018
01:46:25,999 --> 01:46:29,670
So, Earth has wizards now, huh?

1019
01:46:30,921 --> 01:46:34,216
- Tea?
- I don't drink tea.

1020
01:46:34,299 --> 01:46:35,968
What do you drink?

1021
01:46:36,135 --> 01:46:38,387
Not tea.

1022
01:46:41,390 --> 01:46:43,976
So, I keep a watchlist
of individuals and beings

1023
01:46:43,976 --> 01:46:46,562
from other realms that may
be a threat to this world.

1024
01:46:46,645 --> 01:46:50,149
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

1025
01:46:52,234 --> 01:46:55,154
- A worthy inclusion.
- Yeah.

1026
01:46:56,321 --> 01:47:00,159
So,
why bring him here to New York?

1027
01:47:00,242 --> 01:47:04,163
That's a long story.
A family drama, that kind of thing,

1028
01:47:04,163 --> 01:47:06,415
but... we're looking for my father.

1029
01:47:06,748 --> 01:47:09,835
Oh, okay.
So, if you've found Odin,

1030
01:47:10,002 --> 01:47:13,088
you all will return to Asgard,
probably?

1031
01:47:13,171 --> 01:47:16,383
- Oh, yes. Probably.
- Great.

1032
01:47:17,551 --> 01:47:19,219
Allow me to help you.

1033
01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:14,236

1034
01:53:20,436 --> 01:53:21,437
Can I help you?

1035
01:53:22,772 --> 01:53:25,566
They carried you into
Kamar-Taj on a strecher.

1036
01:53:27,401 --> 01:53:28,402
Look at you now.

1037
01:53:28,653 --> 01:53:31,739
- Pangborn.
- Mordo.

1038
01:53:34,742 --> 01:53:36,410
So, what can I do for you? Man!

1039
01:53:36,410 --> 01:53:40,164
You been away many months now
and I heard a revelation.

1040
01:53:41,582 --> 01:53:46,504
The true purpose of a sorcerer is to
twist things out of there proper shape.

1041
01:53:47,588 --> 01:53:53,427
Stealing power, providing
nature... like you.

1042
01:53:54,428 --> 01:53:58,182
I stolen nothing.
This is my power. Mine.

1043
01:53:58,349 --> 01:54:01,769
Power... has a purpose.

1044
01:54:16,742 --> 01:54:17,910
Why you doing this?

1045
01:54:18,744 --> 01:54:21,747
Because I see it long last
was wrong with the world.

1046
01:54:27,086 --> 01:54:29,338
Too many sorcerers.

1047
01:54:31,538 --> 01:54:50,538
