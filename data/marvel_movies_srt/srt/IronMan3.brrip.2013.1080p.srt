1
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:09,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A famous man once said,</font>

2
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:12,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"We create our own demons."</font>

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who said that?
What does that even mean?</font>

4
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't matter.
I said it because he said it.</font>

5
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:19,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, now, he was famous</font>

6
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:21,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's basically getting said
by two well-known guys.</font>

7
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:23,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't...</font>

8
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:25,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to start again.</font>

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's track this from the beginning.</font>

10
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:07,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Half hour till the ball drops.</font>

11
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, do you wanna...
- Tony Stark?</font>

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Great speech, man!
- I got you, pal.</font>

13
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:13,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gave a speech? How was it?</font>

14
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:15,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Edifying.
- Unintelligible.</font>

15
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? It's my favourite kind.
A winning combo.</font>

16
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:18,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where are we going?
- To town, on each other.</font>

17
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:19,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably back in your room</font>

18
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:21,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because I also want
to see your research.</font>

19
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:22,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you can see my research,</font>

20
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:24,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that's...
I'm not gonna show you my "town."</font>

21
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:25,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stark.</font>

22
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:26,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ho Yinsen.</font>

23
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:28,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I finally met a man called "Ho."</font>

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would like to introduce you
to our guest, Dr. Wu.</font>

25
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:33,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, this guy.
- Mr. Stark.</font>

26
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:38,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a heart doctor. She's going to
need a cardiologist after I...</font>

27
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:42,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps another time?</font>

28
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:47,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It started in Bern, Switzerland.
1999.</font>

29
00:01:48,568 --> 00:01:50,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The old days.
- Mr. Stark!</font>

30
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never thought they would
come back to bite me.</font>

31
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:53,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would they?</font>

32
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow! Hey, Tony!</font>

33
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:59,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aldrich Killian.
I'm a big fan of your work.</font>

34
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:00,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My work?
- Who isn't? He means me.</font>

35
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:03,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, but Ms. Hansen,</font>

36
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my organisation's been tracking
your research since year two of MIT.</font>

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we're full.</font>

38
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:10,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, he made it. He made the cut.</font>

39
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:11,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What floor you going to, pal?</font>

40
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, now, that is
an appropriate question.</font>

41
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:14,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ground floor, actually,</font>

42
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:16,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.</font>

43
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:20,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a privately funded think tank
called Advanced Idea Mechanics.</font>

44
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:24,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll take both.
One to throw away and one to not call.</font>

45
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:28,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Advanced Idea Mechanics,"
or "AIM," for short. Do you get it?</font>

46
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:29,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see that,
because it's on your T-shirt.</font>

47
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.</font>

48
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, I'll call you.</font>

49
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:40,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm titillated by the notion
of working with you.</font>

50
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:41,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah?
- I'll ditch these clowns.</font>

51
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you up
on the roof in 5 minutes.</font>

52
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:44,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just gonna try
and get my beak wet real quick.</font>

53
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I'm talking about?</font>

54
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you up there.</font>

55
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:48,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn betcha.</font>

56
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!
I thought that was just a theory.</font>

57
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:52,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it was.</font>

58
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I'm right, we can access the area
of the brain</font>

59
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- that governs repair...
- Wow.</font>

60
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and chemically recode it.</font>

61
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:59,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's incredible. Essentially,
you're hacking into the genetic...</font>

62
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:00,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...operating system...</font>

63
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:02,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ...of a living organism.
- Exactly.</font>

64
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:03,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- Wow.</font>

65
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:04,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that...
Can you...</font>

66
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Can you not touch my plant?</font>

67
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:08,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not...
She doesn't like it. She prefers...</font>

68
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not like the others.
Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.</font>

69
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Happy...
- That's cute...</font>

70
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave her ficus alone.</font>

71
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:14,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because.
And, no, seriously, don't.</font>

72
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:17,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And you're starting with plants.
- For now, yeah.</font>

73
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:19,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm calling it EXTREMIS.</font>

74
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, it's...
- Human application.</font>

75
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly, exactly.</font>

76
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:25,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dendritic revitalisation.
- It's revolutionary.</font>

77
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Disease prevention...
- Change the world.</font>

78
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...even limb regrowth.</font>

79
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the most gifted woman
I've ever met.</font>

80
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:32,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

81
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:35,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- In Switzerland.
- That's better.</font>

82
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:37,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're seeing things.
- This week.</font>

83
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:39,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You almost bought it, didn't you?</font>

84
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what I'm talking about,
the glitch.</font>

85
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you checked
the telomerase algorithm?</font>

86
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The what?
- Down!</font>

87
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay down! Stay down, boss.</font>

88
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:58,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're good.
- Stay down.</font>

89
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:01,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right on me. I made it.</font>

90
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:03,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell was that?</font>

91
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What was that?
- It's a glitch in my work. It's...</font>

92
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:08,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.</font>

93
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not Y2K.</font>

94
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Happy New Year!</font>

95
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:12,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.</font>

96
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:14,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.
I'll see you in the morning. Good night.</font>

97
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You good?
- Yeah.</font>

98
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll be right outside.
- Okay, cool.</font>

99
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:38,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, why am I telling you this?</font>

100
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:42,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I had just created demons</font>

101
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:45,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I didn't even know it.</font>

102
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:49,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, those were good times.</font>

103
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I moved on.</font>

104
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:56,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave,
I said goodbye to the party scene.</font>

105
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:58,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I forgot that night in Switzerland.</font>

106
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:01,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- These days, I'm a changed man.
- 46.</font>

107
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:03,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm different now.</font>

108
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm... Well...</font>

109
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:07,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 47.
- You know who I am.</font>

110
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, please may I request
just a few hours to calibrate...</font>

111
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. 48.</font>

114
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:21,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've also prepared a safety briefing
for you to entirely ignore.</font>

115
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:23,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which I will.</font>

116
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:24,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's do this.</font>

117
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:26,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">DUM-E.</font>

118
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:27,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, DUM-E.</font>

119
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:30,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you get that cap on your head?
You earned it.</font>

120
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Hey!</font>

121
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.</font>

122
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blood on my mat. Handle it.</font>

123
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:42,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, may I remind you that you've been
awake for nearly 72 hours?</font>

124
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Focus up, ladies.</font>

125
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good evening,
and welcome to the birthing suite.</font>

00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:00,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably a little fast.
Slow it down.</font>

136
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:01,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slow it down just a...</font>

137
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:03,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...little bit.</font>

138
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:12,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool it, will you, Jarvis?</font>

139
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:25,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. I ain't scared of you.</font>

140
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:34,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the best.</font>

141
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As always, sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.</font>

142
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:47,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess 72 hours is a long time
between siestas.</font>

143
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't think it could get any worse.</font>

144
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I had to go and turn on the TV.</font>

145
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's when he happened.</font>

146
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:11,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some people call me a terrorist.</font>

147
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I consider myself a teacher.</font>

148
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">America.</font>

149
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:25,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready for another lesson?</font>

150
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:30,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado,
the US military waited</font>

151
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until the friendly Cheyenne braves
had all gone hunting.</font>

152
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:38,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind</font>

153
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:41,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and claim their land.</font>

154
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:43,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">39 hours ago,</font>

155
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:48,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Ali AI Salem Air Base in Kuwait
was attacked.</font>

156
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I... I did that.</font>

157
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:52,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A quaint military church</font>

158
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:55,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">filled with wives and children,
of course.</font>

159
00:08:57,455 --> 00:09:00,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The soldiers were out on manoeuvres.</font>

160
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:04,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The braves were away.</font>

161
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">President Ellis.</font>

162
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:10,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You continue to resist my attempts
to educate you, sir.</font>

163
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:12,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now you've missed me again.</font>

164
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know who I am.</font>

165
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:19,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know where I am.</font>

166
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you'll never see me coming.</font>

167
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now that we seem to be back,</font>

168
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">let's recap some
of the frightening developments...</font>

169
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:32,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">American airwaves were hijacked...</font>

170
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:33,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The nation remains on high alert.</font>

171
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:36,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All attempts to find the Mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful.</font>

172
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:39,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Central to my administration's
response to this terrorist event</font>

173
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a newly minted resource.</font>

174
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know him as Colonel James Rhodes.</font>

175
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The American people
will soon know him</font>

176
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:49,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as the Iron Patriot.</font>

177
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how is President Ellis responding?</font>

178
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By taking the guy
they call War Machine</font>

179
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:56,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and giving him a paint job.</font>

180
00:09:56,597 --> 00:10:00,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The same suit,
but painted red, white and blue.</font>

181
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:04,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that. And they also
renamed him, "lron Patriot."</font>

182
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
just in case the paint was too subtle.</font>

183
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It tested well with focus groups,
all right?</font>

184
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I am Iron Patriot!" it sucks.</font>

185
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"War Machine" was
a little too aggressive.</font>

186
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:14,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right?
This sends a better message.</font>

187
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what's really going on?
With the Mandarin.</font>

188
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously, can we talk about this guy?</font>

189
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:28,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's classified information, Tony.</font>

190
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, there have been 9 bombings.</font>

191
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 9.
- The public only knows about 3.</font>

192
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:36,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But here's the thing,
nobody can ID a device.</font>

193
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:37,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no bomb casings.</font>

194
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:40,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I can help. Just ask.</font>

195
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit.</font>

196
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:45,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got bomb disposal.
It catches explosions in mid-air.</font>

197
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When's the last time
you got a good night's sleep?</font>

198
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:49,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Einstein slept 3 hours a year.
Look what he did.</font>

199
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People are concerned about you, Tony.
I'm concerned about you.</font>

200
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:53,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to come at me like that?</font>

201
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not trying to be a dick...</font>

202
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:57,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...tator.</font>

203
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:58,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you mind signing my drawing?</font>

204
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:01,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Richard doesn't mind.
Are you all right with this, Dick?</font>

205
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:02,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Fine with me.</font>

206
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:06,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's your name?
- Erin.</font>

207
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:10,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I loved you in A Christmas Story,
by the way.</font>

208
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, the Pentagon is scared.</font>

209
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:16,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After New York, aliens... Come on.</font>

210
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:17,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They need to look strong.</font>

211
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:21,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stopping the Mandarin is a priority,
but it's not...</font>

212
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:22,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's not superhero business.
- No, it's not, quite frankly.</font>

213
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I get it.
- It's American business.</font>

214
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:26,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I said I got it.</font>

215
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:28,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

216
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I broke the crayon.</font>

217
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay, Mr. Stark?</font>

218
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it easy. Tony.</font>

219
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:37,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you get out of the Wormhole?</font>

220
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:38,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute. Tony!</font>

221
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:40,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What did you say?
- Tony.</font>

222
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:42,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

223
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:44,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just checking on the suit.</font>

224
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:46,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

225
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check the heart.</font>

226
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it the brain?</font>

227
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:55,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No sign of cardiac anomaly
or unusual brain activity.</font>

228
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so I was poisoned?</font>

229
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:02,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My diagnosis is that you've
experienced a severe anxiety attack.</font>

230
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:06,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me?</font>

231
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, man, this isn't a good look.
Open up.</font>

232
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, I gotta split.</font>

233
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Badge.</font>

234
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:15,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Badge.</font>

235
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, badge.</font>

236
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Badge, guys.
I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.</font>

237
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony has got them in his basement.
They're wearing party hats.</font>

238
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:26,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is an asset that we can put to use.</font>

239
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:30,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you're suggesting that I replace
the entire janitorial staff with robots.</font>

240
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- What I'm saying is that</font>

241
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:35,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the human element of human resources
is our biggest point of vulnerability.</font>

242
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:38,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should start
phasing it out immediately.</font>

243
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:39,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Excuse me, Bambi,</font>

244
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:40,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You should be wearing...
- Did you just say that?</font>

245
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Security? Yes?
- Happy? Okay.</font>

246
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:45,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am thrilled that you are now
the Head Of Security. Okay?</font>

247
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.</font>

248
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- However...
- I do appreciate it.</font>

249
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ...since you've taken the post...
- You don't have to thank me.</font>

250
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...we've had a rise in staff complaints
of 300%.</font>

251
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

252
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:57,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a compliment.</font>

253
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not...
It is a compliment.</font>

254
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clearly, somebody's
trying to hide something.</font>

255
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:01,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I... Yes.
- Excuse me.</font>

256
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:03,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Potts, your 4:00 is here.</font>

257
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- Did you clear this 4:00 with me?</font>

258
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy, we'll talk about this later,</font>

259
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:09,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but right now, I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.</font>

260
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How so?</font>

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to work with him
and he used to ask me out all the time,</font>

262
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:14,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so it's a little awkward.</font>

263
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:16,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like the sound of that.</font>

264
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:22,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pepper</font>

265
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:24,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Killian?</font>

266
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:26,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look great.</font>

267
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:27,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look really great.</font>

268
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, you look great.</font>

269
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I... I.-</font>

270
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:33,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What on earth have you been doing?</font>

271
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:34,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing fancy.</font>

272
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just 5 years in the hands
of physical therapists.</font>

273
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And please, call me Aldrich.</font>

274
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were supposed to be
issued a security badge.</font>

275
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:44,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Happy, it's okay. We're good.
- Yes.</font>

276
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:46,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes. Stand down.</font>

277
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:48,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm going to linger right here. Okay.
- Thank you.</font>

278
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's very nice to see you, Killian.</font>

279
00:13:58,047 --> 00:13:59,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guy-</font>

280
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:08,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Merry Christmas.</font>

281
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:13,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After years dodging the President's ban
on "immoral" biotech research,</font>

282
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:14,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my think tank</font>

283
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">now has a little something
in the pipeline.</font>

284
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:24,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an idea we like to call EXTREMIS.</font>

285
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna turn your lights down.</font>

286
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Regard the human brain.</font>

287
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, hold on, hold on.</font>

288
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's...
That's the universe. My bad.</font>

289
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if I do that...</font>

290
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the brain.</font>

291
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strangely mimetic, though,
wouldn't you say?</font>

292
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, that's amazing.</font>

293
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, it's mine.</font>

294
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

295
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This. You're inside my head.</font>

296
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a...
It's a live feed.</font>

297
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:02,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on up, I'll prove it to you.</font>

298
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:04,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

299
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:08,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, pinch my arm.</font>

300
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can take it. Pinch me.</font>

301
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:14,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

302
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:18,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the primary somatosensory cortex.
It's the brain's pain centre.</font>

303
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this is what I wanted to show you.</font>

304
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:28,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, EXTREMIS harnesses
our bioelectrical potential</font>

305
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:31,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it goes here.</font>

306
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:34,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is essentially an empty slot
and what this tells us</font>

307
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is that our mind,</font>

308
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:38,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">our entire DNA, in fact,</font>

309
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:40,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is destined to be upgraded.</font>

310
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

311
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait...</font>

312
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

313
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:53,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is this Forehead Of Security?
- What?</font>

314
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:55,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, look...
I got a real job. What do you want?</font>

315
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:56,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm working.
I've got something going on, here.</font>

316
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:57,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, harassing interns?</font>

317
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me tell you something.
Do you know what happened</font>

318
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?</font>

319
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They would laugh in my face.</font>

320
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to leave
while I still had a shred of dignity.</font>

321
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I got a real job.
I'm watching Pepper.</font>

322
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on? Fill me in.</font>

323
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:09,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- For real?
- Yeah.</font>

324
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.
She's meeting up with this scientist.</font>

325
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Rich guy. Handsome.
- Right.</font>

326
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:15,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't make his face, at first. Right?
You know I'm good with faces.</font>

327
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:16,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, you're the best.
- Yeah.</font>

328
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, so I run his credentials.
I make him.</font>

329
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aldrich Killian.
We actually met the guy back in...</font>

330
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where were we in '99?
The science conference?</font>

331
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Switzerland.
- Right, right, exactly.</font>

332
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Killian. No...
I don't remember that guy.</font>

333
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course you don't remember him.
He's not a blond with a big rack.</font>

334
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At first, it was fine.
They were talking business.</font>

335
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now it's getting weird.
He's showing her his big brain.</font>

336
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- His what?
- Big brain.</font>

337
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she likes it.
Here, let me show you.</font>

338
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on. See?</font>

339
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at what? You, watching them?</font>

340
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:43,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flip the screen,
and then we can get started.</font>

341
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:46,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a tech genius like you.
Just trust me. Get down here.</font>

342
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flip the screen.
Then I can see what they're doing.</font>

343
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:49,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't!
I don't know how to flip the screen!</font>

344
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't talk to me like that any more.
You're not my boss.</font>

345
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:53,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right?
I don't work for you.</font>

346
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I don't trust this guy.
He's got another guy with him.</font>

347
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:57,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's shifty.</font>

348
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:58,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Relax.
- Seriously?</font>

349
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just asking you
to secure the perimeter.</font>

350
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:01,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell them to go out
for a drink or something.</font>

351
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:03,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.</font>

352
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This woman's the best thing
that ever happened to you</font>

353
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're just ignoring her.</font>

354
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:08,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A giant brain?
- Yeah.</font>

355
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a giant brain.
There's a shifty character.</font>

356
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna
run his plates and I'm gonna...</font>

357
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
if it gets rough, so be it.</font>

358
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I miss you, Happy-</font>

359
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I miss you, too.
But the way it used to be.</font>

360
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:19,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you're off with the super-friends.</font>

361
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what's going on
with you any more.</font>

362
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:21,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The world's getting weird.
- Hey!</font>

363
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate to cut you off.</font>

364
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you have your Taser on you?
- Why?</font>

365
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:26,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think there's a gal in H.R.
who's trying to steal some printer ink.</font>

366
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should probably go over there
and zap her.</font>

367
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:29,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, nice.</font>

368
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of any living organism</font>

369
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and recode its DNA.</font>

370
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would be incredible.</font>

371
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:42,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unfortunately, to my ears,
it also sounds highly weaponisable.</font>

372
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:46,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As in, enhanced soldiers,
private armies, and Tony is...</font>

373
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, Tony-</font>

374
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:53,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I invited Tony to join AIM
13 years ago.</font>

375
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:54,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He turned me down.</font>

376
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:59,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But something tells me,
now there's a new genius on the throne</font>

377
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:02,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who doesn't have to
answer to Tony anymore</font>

378
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and who has slightly less of an ego.</font>

379
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.</font>

380
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:12,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As much as I'd like to help you.</font>

381
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:17,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I can't say that
I'm not disappointed.</font>

382
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:18,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then, as my father used to say,</font>

383
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:21,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Failure is the fog
through which we glimpse triumph."</font>

384
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's very deep.</font>

385
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I have no idea what it means.</font>

386
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:28,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, me neither.
He was kind of an idiot, my old man.</font>

387
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:31,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.</font>

388
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy-</font>

389
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Car's ready, if you're ready to go.</font>

390
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I just...</font>

391
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I forgot my other things, so...</font>

392
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:55,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just gonna...</font>

393
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:23,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry I'm late. I was...</font>

394
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the...
What is that?</font>

395
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're wearing this in the house now?</font>

396
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that, like, Mark 15?</font>

397
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Something like that.
You know, everybody needs a hobby.</font>

398
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?</font>

399
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just breaking it in.</font>

400
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, it's always a little pinchy
in the gooey bag at first, so...</font>

401
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, hey, did you see
your Christmas present?</font>

402
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:45,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I did. I...</font>

403
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:48,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know how I could've
missed that Christmas present.</font>

404
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it gonna fit through the door?</font>

405
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, actually, it's a good question.</font>

406
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a team of guys coming tomorrow.
They're gonna blow out that wall.</font>

407
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- So...</font>

408
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tense? Good day? Huh?</font>

409
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoulders, a little knotty.
Naughty girl.</font>

410
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to harp on this,
but did you like the custom rabbit?</font>

411
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I like it?</font>

412
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:06,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nailed it, right?
- Wow.</font>

413
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I appreciate the thought very much.</font>

414
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:14,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, why don't you lift up that face mask
and give me a kiss?</font>

415
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:19,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep. Damn it, no can do.</font>

416
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:23,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to just kiss it
on the... The facial slit?</font>

417
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, why don't I
run down to the garage</font>

418
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:28,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and see if I can't find a crowbar
to Jimmy that thing open?</font>

419
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crowbar, yeah.</font>

420
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:32,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except there's been a radiation leak.</font>

421
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll take my chances.
- That's risky.</font>

422
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:37,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least, let me get you, like,
a hazmat suit.</font>

423
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:40,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A Geiger counter or something like that.</font>

424
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Busted.</font>

425
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:46,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is a new level of lame.
- Sorry.</font>

426
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:49,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ate without me already?
On date night?</font>

427
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He was just...
- You mean you.</font>

428
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:54,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, yeah, I just mean
we were hosting you...</font>

429
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...while I finished up a little work.</font>

430
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:58,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yes, I had a quick bite.</font>

431
00:20:58,634 --> 00:20:59,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know if you were coming home</font>

432
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or you were having drinks
with Aldrich Killian.</font>

433
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:06,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- What?</font>

434
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aldrich Killian?
What, are you checking up on me?</font>

435
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy was concerned.</font>

436
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're spying on me.
- I wasn't.</font>

437
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:12,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on.</font>

438
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Pep?</font>

439
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I admit it.</font>

440
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:19,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My fault. Sorry.</font>

441
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a piping hot mess.</font>

442
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:27,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been going on for a while.
I haven't said anything.</font>

443
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing's been the same
since New York.</font>

444
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? I didn't notice that at all.</font>

445
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You experience things</font>

446
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:39,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then they're over,
and you still can't explain them.</font>

447
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:44,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gods, aliens, other dimensions.
I'm just a man in a can.</font>

448
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only reason I haven't cracked up</font>

449
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is probably because you moved in.</font>

450
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:49,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is great.</font>

451
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you. I'm lucky.</font>

452
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:54,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But honey, I can't sleep.</font>

453
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:58,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know.</font>

454
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tinker. I....</font>

455
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Threat is imminent.</font>

456
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:07,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I have to protect the one thing
that I can't live without.</font>

457
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's you.</font>

458
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And my suits, they're...</font>

459
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:12,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Machines.</font>

460
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're part of me.</font>

461
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A distraction.</font>

462
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.</font>

463
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna take a shower.</font>

464
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

465
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:43,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're gonna join me.</font>

466
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:46,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better.</font>

467
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:06,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony.</font>

468
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony. Tony.</font>

469
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To...</font>

470
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Power down!</font>

471
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must have called it in my sleep.</font>

472
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not supposed to happen.</font>

473
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll recalibrate the sensors.</font>

474
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:38,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we just... Just let me...</font>

475
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just let me catch my breath. Hey,
don't... Don't go. All right? Pepper...</font>

476
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to sleep downstairs.</font>

477
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:45,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tinker with that.</font>

478
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:12,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you regulate?</font>

479
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:13,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I can regulate.</font>

480
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You sure about that?
- Yes.</font>

481
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a decent batch.</font>

482
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:30,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't say I never did nothing for you.
- Thank you.</font>

483
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:35,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, for understanding.</font>

484
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:44,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, buddy.</font>

485
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing, buddy?</font>

486
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You out by yourself?
A little date night?</font>

487
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:04,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seeing your favourite
chick flick, maybe?</font>

488
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, a little movie
called The Party's Over,</font>

489
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">starring you and your junkie girlfriend.</font>

490
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's the ticket.</font>

491
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No kidding. That doesn't belong to you.</font>

492
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:39,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Savin!</font>

493
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:42,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help!</font>

494
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me!</font>

496
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:13,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They look Chinese.</font>

497
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:16,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They sound Chinese.</font>

498
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:20,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they're actually
an American invention.</font>

499
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:25,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is why they're hollow,
full of lies</font>

500
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and leave a bad taste in the mouth.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President,</font>

504
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:42,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know this must be getting frustrating.</font>

505
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:47,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this season of terror
is drawing to a close.</font>

506
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And don't worry, the big one is coming.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your graduation.</font>

508
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:08,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

509
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:10,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you mind leaving that on?</font>

510
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

511
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:23,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sunday nights. PBS. Downton Abbey.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's his show. He thinks it's elegant.</font>

513
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:31,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One more thing. Make sure
everyone wears their badges.</font>

514
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:32,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a stickler for that sort of thing.</font>

515
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:36,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plus, my guys
won't let anyone in without them.</font>

516
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're awaiting the arrival
of Tony Stark.</font>

517
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:39,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're hoping he'll give us
the reaction...</font>

518
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:41,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His reaction
to the latest attack.</font>

519
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:44,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stark, hi there.</font>

520
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:47,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our sources are telling us that all signs
are pointing to another Mandarin attack.</font>

521
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything else you can tell us?</font>

522
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:52,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Mr. Stark.
When is somebody gonna kill this guy?</font>

523
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just saying.</font>

524
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that what you want?</font>

525
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's a little holiday greeting</font>

526
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:06,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been wanting to send
to the Mandarin.</font>

527
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:08,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just didn't know
how to phrase it until now.</font>

528
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:12,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Tony Stark
and I'm not afraid of you.</font>

529
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you're a coward.
So I've decided</font>

530
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:17,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you just died, pal.</font>

531
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna come get the body.</font>

532
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:22,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no politics here.
It's just good old-fashioned revenge.</font>

Lots of theatre. Close.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">The heat from the blast was in excess

Are you sure that's not one of his?</font>

565
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The incident was the use of a bomb

579
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not the Mandarin.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you? Are you?</font>

581
00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:41,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't remember.</font>

582
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why am I not surprised?</font>

583
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:45,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't take it personally. I don't
remember what I had for breakfast.</font>

00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gluten-free waffles, sir.</font>

585
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:48,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

586
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:51,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, look, I need to be alone with you,
someplace not here.</font>

587
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:52,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's urgent.</font>

588
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:58,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing,
but now I'm in a committed relationship.</font>

589
00:32:58,853 --> 00:32:59,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's...</font>

590
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- With her.
- Tony?</font>

591
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:07,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is somebody there?
- Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't tell me
there's a 12-year-old kid</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">waiting in the car that I've never met.</font>

596
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:15,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's 13.</font>

597
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:17,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I need your help.</font>

598
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, what for? Why now?</font>

599
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I read the papers, and frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.</font>

600
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:23,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be fine.</font>

601
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:27,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, with Happy in the hospital,
I didn't know we were expecting guests.</font>

602
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:29,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We weren't.
- And old girlfriends.</font>

603
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:31,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She's not, really.
- No, not really.</font>

604
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:34,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It was just one night.
- Yep.</font>

605
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:36,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how you did it, isn't it?</font>

606
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It was a great night.
- Yep. Well, you know.</font>

607
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You saved yourself a world of pain.
- What?</font>

608
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:42,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sure.
- Trust me. We're going out of town.</font>

609
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. We've been through this.</font>

610
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:44,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nope.
- Yep!</font>

611
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The man says no.
- Immediately and indefinitely.</font>

612
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Honey...
- Great idea. Let's go.</font>

613
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:50,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, that's a terrible idea.
Please don't touch her bags.</font>

614
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is how normal people behave.</font>

615
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't protect you out there.</font>

616
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is... Is that normal?</font>

617
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:58,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sadly, that is very normal.
- Yes, this is normal!</font>

618
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:00,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a big bunny. Relax about it!</font>

619
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Calm down.</font>

620
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:04,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I got this for you.
- I'm aware of that.</font>

621
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:05,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still haven't even
told me you liked it.</font>

622
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:06,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like it.</font>

623
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:07,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I asked you three...
You don't like it.</font>

624
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We are leaving the house.
- Guys?</font>

625
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:10,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not even up for discussion.</font>

626
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:12,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can we...
- I said no. What?</font>

627
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do we need to worry about that?</font>

628
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:04,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you.</font>

629
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:06,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you first.</font>

630
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like I said, we can't stay here.</font>

631
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move! I'm right behind you.</font>

632
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:24,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get her. I'm gonna find a way around.</font>

633
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop stopping. Get her. Get outside.</font>

634
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:29,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

635
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:53,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. Tony!</font>

636
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:10,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, Ms. Potts
is clear of the structure.</font>

637
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis, where's my flight power?</font>

638
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:46,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Working on it, sir. This is a prototype.</font>

639
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's one.</font>

640
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, the suit is not combat ready.</font>

641
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:24,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's two.</font>

642
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:39,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony!</font>

643
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:14,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, take a deep breath.</font>

644
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flight power restored.</font>

645
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:48,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir?</font>

646
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:50,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir!</font>

647
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, kill the alarm. I got it.</font>

648
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:57,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the emergency alert triggered by
the power dropping below 5%.</font>

649
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:37,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's snowing, right?
Where are we, upstate?</font>

650
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:41,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are 5 miles outside of
Rose Hill, Tennessee.</font>

651
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:42,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

652
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:45,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis. Not my idea.</font>

653
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:48,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are we doing here?
This is thousands of miles away!</font>

654
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:49,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta get Pepper-</font>

655
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:52,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I prepared a flight plan.
This was the location.</font>

656
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who asked you?</font>

657
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:55,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the suit.</font>

658
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:58,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.</font>

659
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:58,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open it, J.</font>

660
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:06,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's brisk.</font>

661
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:16,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I'll just cosy back up for a...</font>

662
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:19,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I actually think
I need to sleep now, sir.</font>

663
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:20,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis.</font>

664
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:24,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis?</font>

665
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:29,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't leave me, buddy.</font>

668
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:59,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a lot of apologies to make
and not a lot of time so...</font>

669
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:02,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.</font>

670
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:06,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was selfish and stupid,
and it won't happen again.</font>

671
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:09,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, it's Christmas time
and the rabbit's too big.</font>

672
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:11,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Done. Sorry.</font>

673
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm sorry in advance</font>

674
00:42:14,017 --> 00:42:16,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because I can't come home yet.</font>

675
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to find this guy.</font>

676
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:22,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta stay safe, that's all I know.</font>

677
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:26,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just stole a poncho
from a wooden Indian.</font>

678
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:51,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get you comfy.</font>

679
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:56,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You happy now?</font>

680
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freeze!</font>

681
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move.</font>

682
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:13,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got me.</font>

683
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:16,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice potato gun.</font>

684
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:18,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Barrel's a little long.</font>

685
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:22,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Between that and the wide gauge,
it's gonna diminish your FPS.</font>

686
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:27,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now you're out of ammo.</font>

687
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:30,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that thing on your chest?</font>

688
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:33,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an electromagnet.</font>

689

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should know,
you got a box of them right here.</font>

691
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:47,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

692
00:43:49,128 --> 00:43:50,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That...</font>

693
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's...
Is that Iron Man?</font>

694
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:56,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Technically, I am.</font>

695
00:43:56,927 --> 00:43:59,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Technically, you're dead.</font>

696
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:02,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Valid point.</font>

697
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:03,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to him?</font>

698
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:05,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life.</font>

699
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:07,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I built him. I take care of him.</font>

700
00:44:09,732 --> 00:44:10,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll fix him.</font>

701
00:44:10,816 --> 00:44:11,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a mechanic?</font>

702
00:44:11,942 --> 00:44:13,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

703
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:17,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I was building
Iron Man and War Machine...</font>

704
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:18,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's "Iron Patriot" now-</font>

705
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:20,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's way cooler.</font>

706
00:44:20,326 --> 00:44:21,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's not.</font>

707
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:25,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyways, I would have added in
the retro...</font>

708
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:28,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Retro-reflective panels?
- To make him stealth mode.</font>

709
00:44:28,751 --> 00:44:30,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You want a stealth mode?
- Cool, right?</font>

710
00:44:30,227 --> 00:44:31,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.</font>

711
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:34,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not a good idea.
- Oops.</font>

712
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?
You're gonna break his finger?</font>

713
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:38,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's in pain. He's been injured.
Leave him alone.</font>

714
00:44:38,177 --> 00:44:39,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

715
00:44:39,345 --> 00:44:40,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you?</font>

716
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:44,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.</font>

717
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:46,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, who's home?</font>

718
00:44:46,435 --> 00:44:50,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mom already left for the diner,
and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.</font>

719
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:54,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess he won,
because that was 6 years ago.</font>

720
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:58,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which happens. Dads leave.
No need to be a pussy about it.</font>

721
00:44:58,689 --> 00:44:59,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's what I need.</font>

722
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:03,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A laptop, a digital watch,
a cell phone,</font>

723
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:06,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the pneumatic actuator
from your bazooka over there,</font>

724
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:09,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a map of town, a big spring
and a tuna fish sandwich.</font>

725
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's in it for me?</font>

726
00:45:11,794 --> 00:45:14,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Salvation. What's his name?
- Who?</font>

727
00:45:14,797 --> 00:45:18,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The kid that bullies you at school.
What's his name?</font>

728
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:19,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you know that?</font>

729
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:21,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got just the thing.</font>

730
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:27,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a pinata for a cricket.</font>

731
00:45:27,351 --> 00:45:28,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm kidding.
This is a very powerful weapon.</font>

732
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:32,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Point it away from your face,
press the button on top,</font>

733
00:45:32,481 --> 00:45:33,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it discourages bullying.</font>

734
00:45:34,483 --> 00:45:37,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass.
Deal?</font>

735
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deal? What do you say?</font>

736
00:45:39,655 --> 00:45:41,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Deal.
- Deal?</font>

737
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:43,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your name?</font>

738
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:46,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harley. And you're...</font>

739
00:45:46,662 --> 00:45:47,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The mechanic.</font>

740
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:50,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony.</font>

741
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what keeps
going through my head?</font>

742
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:55,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Where's my sandwich?"</font>

743
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:06,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Tony Stark?</font>

744
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:38,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stark secure server.
Retinal scan verified.</font>

745
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:39,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pepper, it's me.</font>

746
00:46:39,548 --> 00:46:42,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a lot of apologies to make
and not a lot of time so...</font>

747
00:46:42,551 --> 00:46:45,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.</font>

748
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:48,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was selfish and stupid
and it won't happen again.</font>

749
00:46:50,476 --> 00:46:51,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why were you at the house tonight?</font>

750
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:55,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was so important
that you had to speak to Tony?</font>

751
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:02,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think that my boss
is working for the Mandarin.</font>

752
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:04,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if you still want to talk about it</font>

753
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:08,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suggest that we get
ourselves someplace safe.</font>

754
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:12,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your boss works for the Mandarin,
you think?</font>

755
00:47:12,498 --> 00:47:14,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But Tony says you're a botanist. So...</font>

756
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:17,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That figures. What I actually am
is a biological DNA coder</font>

757
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">running a team of 40
out of a privately funded think tank.</font>

758
00:47:19,922 --> 00:47:21,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But sure, you can call me a botanist.</font>

759
00:47:23,926 --> 00:47:26,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This boss of yours,
does he have a name?</font>

760
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:28,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Aldrich Killian.</font>

761
00:47:32,142 --> 00:47:34,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We took the house down, sir.
But there's no sign of a body.</font>

762
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:35,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I see.
- No Stark.</font>

763
00:47:36,063 --> 00:47:38,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to go.</font>

764
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:40,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The master is about to record
and he's a little...</font>

765
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:43,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you know how he gets.</font>

766
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:46,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep your appointment tonight
and call me when it's done.</font>

767
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:54,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, everybody.
No talking and no eye contact.</font>

768
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless you want to get shot in the face.</font>

769
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:09,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Report in.</font>

770
00:48:11,682 --> 00:48:12,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Path is clear.</font>

771
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:19,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The master is travelling.</font>

772
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:37,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then, what are we waiting for?</font>

773
00:48:39,293 --> 00:48:41,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sandwich was fair,
the spring was a little rusty,</font>

774
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the rest of the materials, I'll make do.</font>

775
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:45,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way,
when you said your sister had a watch...</font>

776
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:46,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah?
- ...l was kind of hoping</font>

777
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:49,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for something a little more
adult than that.</font>

778
00:48:49,303 --> 00:48:52,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's 6.
Anyway, it's a limited edition.</font>

779
00:48:53,015 --> 00:48:54,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When can we talk about New York?</font>

780
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:56,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe never. Relax about it.</font>

781
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:57,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the Avengers?
Can we talk about them?</font>

782
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I dunno. Later.
Hey, kid, give me a little space.</font>

783
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:07,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the official story here?
What happened?</font>

784
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:12,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess this guy named Chad Davis
used to live roundabouts.</font>

785
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won a bunch of medals in the army.</font>

786
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And one day, folks said he went crazy
and made, you know, a bomb.</font>

787
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:23,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then he blew himself up, right here.</font>

788
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 6 people died, right?
- Yeah.</font>

789
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:33,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Including Chad Davis.
- Yeah, yeah.</font>

790
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:42,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. That doesn't make sense.</font>

791
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:44,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think about it.</font>

792
00:49:45,442 --> 00:49:47,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6 dead. Only 5 shadows.</font>

793
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:49,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

794
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:52,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People said these shadows are
like the marks of souls going to heaven.</font>

795
00:49:53,784 --> 00:49:55,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except the bomb guy.</font>

796
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:59,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He went to hell,
on account of he didn't get a shadow.</font>

797
00:49:59,581 --> 00:50:00,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why there's only 5.</font>

798
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:04,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you buy that?
- It's what everyone says.</font>

799
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:09,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what
this crater reminds me of?</font>

800
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:12,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No idea. I'm not...
I don't care.</font>

801
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:18,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That giant Wormhole in New York.</font>

802
00:50:18,517 --> 00:50:20,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does it remind you?</font>

803
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:22,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's manipulative.
I don't want to talk about it.</font>

804
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:24,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are they coming back? The aliens?</font>

805
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:26,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe. Can you stop?</font>

806
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:29,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember what I told you,
that I have an anxiety issue?</font>

807
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does this subject make you edgy?</font>

808
00:50:31,947 --> 00:50:34,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch
my breath for a second?</font>

809
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:36,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are there bad guys in Rose Hill?</font>

810
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:38,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you need a plastic bag
to breathe into?</font>

811
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you have medication?
- No.</font>

812
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:41,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you need to be on it?
- Probably.</font>

813
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:43,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you have PTSD?
- I don't think so.</font>

814
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:45,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you going completely mental?</font>

815
00:50:45,836 --> 00:50:47,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can stop. Do you want me to stop?</font>

816
00:50:48,255 --> 00:50:49,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember when I said
to stop doing that?</font>

817
00:50:49,548 --> 00:50:52,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear that you're gonna freak me out.</font>

818
00:50:54,428 --> 00:50:56,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, you did it, didn't you?
You happy now?</font>

819
00:50:56,596 --> 00:50:57,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did I say?</font>

820
00:50:58,181 --> 00:50:59,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Wait up!</font>

821
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:02,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait.</font>

822
00:51:07,149 --> 00:51:08,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell was that?</font>

823
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:15,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your fault. You spazzed me out.</font>

824
00:51:16,825 --> 00:51:19,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, back to business.
Where were we?</font>

825
00:51:19,286 --> 00:51:20,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The guy who died.</font>

826
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:23,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relatives? Mom?
Mrs. Davis, where is she?</font>

827
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:24,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where she always is.</font>

828
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:27,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? Now, you're being helpful.</font>

829
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:34,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

830
00:51:34,134 --> 00:51:35,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lady?</font>

831
00:51:36,553 --> 00:51:38,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this...</font>

832
00:51:39,556 --> 00:51:40,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

833
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:45,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice haircut. it suits you.</font>

834
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:47,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice watch.</font>

835
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:48,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. A limited edition.</font>

836
00:51:49,483 --> 00:51:51,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't doubt it.</font>

837
00:51:52,569 --> 00:51:53,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, have a good evening.</font>

838
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:07,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

839
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:18,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Davis?</font>

840
00:52:19,638 --> 00:52:20,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind if I join you?</font>

841
00:52:21,515 --> 00:52:22,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Free country.</font>

842
00:52:23,016 --> 00:52:24,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure is.</font>

843
00:52:29,064 --> 00:52:30,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

844
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:33,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where would you like to start?</font>

845
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:37,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want to say,
I'm sorry about your loss.</font>

846
00:52:37,197 --> 00:52:38,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to know
what you think happened.</font>

847
00:52:40,826 --> 00:52:45,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I brought your damn file.
You take it, go.</font>

848
00:52:46,748 --> 00:52:50,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever was in here,
he wanted no part of it.</font>

849
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:54,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clearly, you're waiting
for someone else. Huh?</font>

850
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:55,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Supposed to meet someone here?</font>

851
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:56,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

852
00:53:10,772 --> 00:53:13,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Davis,
your son didn't kill himself.</font>

853
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:15,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guarantee you, he didn't kill anyone.</font>

854
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone used him.</font>

855
00:53:19,281 --> 00:53:20,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

856
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:22,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a weapon.</font>

857
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:30,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not the person
that called me after all, are you?</font>

858
00:53:31,084 --> 00:53:32,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, I am.</font>

859
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:39,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, hey! What's all this about?
What the hell is going on here?</font>

860
00:53:40,093 --> 00:53:41,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called an arrest.</font>

861
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:45,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sheriff, is it?
- Yes, ma'am, it is. And you are?</font>

862
00:53:45,891 --> 00:53:47,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Homeland Security. We good here?</font>

863
00:53:48,018 --> 00:53:49,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we're not "good."</font>

864
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:51,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a little more information
than that.</font>

865
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's a little above
your pay grade, Sheriff.</font>

866
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:57,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah? Why don't you get on the horn
to Nashville, and upgrade me?</font>

867
00:53:57,736 --> 00:54:00,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. You know what?
I was hoping to do this the smart way</font>

868
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:03,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the fun way is always good.</font>

869
00:54:04,576 --> 00:54:06,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deputy, get this woman out of...</font>

870
00:54:19,591 --> 00:54:22,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hot wings, you want to party?
Come on, you and me, let's go.</font>

871
00:54:35,899 --> 00:54:37,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Crazy, huh?
- Yep.</font>

872
00:54:39,361 --> 00:54:40,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch this.</font>

873
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:50,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You walked right into this one.
I've dated hotter chicks than you.</font>

874
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:52,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all you got?</font>

875
00:55:54,269 --> 00:55:55,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?</font>

876
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:59,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweetheart, that could be
the name of my autobiography.</font>

877
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let me go!
- Help me!</font>

878
00:57:06,216 --> 00:57:07,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway-</font>

879
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:10,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, kid,
what would you like for Christmas?</font>

880
00:57:10,678 --> 00:57:12,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stark, I am so sorry.</font>

881
00:57:12,722 --> 00:57:13,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.
I think he was trying to say,</font>

882
00:57:14,015 --> 00:57:15,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I want my goddamn file."</font>

883
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:17,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not your fault, kid.</font>

884
00:57:20,355 --> 00:57:21,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember what I told you
about bullies?</font>

885
00:57:28,446 --> 00:57:29,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like that, Westworld?</font>

886
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:31,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the thing about smart guys,</font>

887
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we always cover our ass.</font>

888
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:00,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome.</font>

889
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:02,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For what? Did I miss something?</font>

890
00:58:02,856 --> 00:58:04,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, saving your life.</font>

891
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:08,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. A, I saved you first.
B, thanks. Sort of.</font>

892
00:58:08,111 --> 00:58:10,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And C, if you do someone a solid,
don't be a yutz.</font>

893
00:58:10,947 --> 00:58:14,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right? Just play it cool.
Otherwise you come off grandiose.</font>

894
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:16,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unlike you?</font>

895
00:58:17,704 --> 00:58:19,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Admit it, you need me.</font>

896
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:21,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're connected.</font>

897
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:23,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I need is for you to go home,
be with your mom,</font>

898
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:25,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">keep your trap shut, guard the suit,</font>

899
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and stay connected to the telephone,</font>

900
00:58:27,255 --> 00:58:28,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because if I call,
you better pick up. Okay?</font>

901
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:32,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you feel that? We're done here.</font>

902
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move out of the way,
or I'm gonna run you over.</font>

903
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:35,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye, kid.</font>

904
00:58:41,895 --> 00:58:43,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, kid.</font>

905
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:45,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did good.</font>

906
00:58:45,607 --> 00:58:48,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, now you're just gonna
leave me here, like my dad?</font>

907
00:58:50,195 --> 00:58:51,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

908
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:54,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, you're guilt-tripping me,
aren't you?</font>

909
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:55,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm cold.</font>

910
00:58:56,034 --> 00:58:58,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can tell. You know how I can tell?</font>

911
00:58:59,746 --> 00:59:01,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because we're connected.</font>

912
00:59:05,043 --> 00:59:07,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was worth a shot.</font>

913
00:59:20,058 --> 00:59:21,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get this.
It's affordable. It's gorgeous.</font>

914
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It goes with any decor...</font>

915
00:59:25,313 --> 00:59:27,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What happened to picture?
- Go to override.</font>

916
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How is this happening again?
- Fine. Override to Los Angeles.</font>

917
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:32,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying. There's nothing I can...</font>

918
00:59:32,904 --> 00:59:33,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, where is the feed coming from?</font>

919
00:59:34,155 --> 00:59:36,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know,
it's in all of our receivers and I...</font>

920
00:59:36,157 --> 00:59:38,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The entire East Coast,
the satellites are down.</font>

921
00:59:38,368 --> 00:59:39,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not just our station.</font>

922
00:59:39,786 --> 00:59:40,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about a backup manual?</font>

923
00:59:41,037 --> 00:59:42,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have an unauthorised
broadcast cutting through...</font>

924
00:59:43,206 --> 00:59:47,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Vice President,
I think you should see this.</font>

925
00:59:48,878 --> 00:59:50,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, not again.</font>

926
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:52,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is the President getting this?</font>

927
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:05,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President.</font>

928
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:07,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only two lessons remain.</font>

929
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:11,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I intend to finish this
before Christmas morning.</font>

930
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:14,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meet Thomas Richards.</font>

931
01:00:14,487 --> 01:00:17,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good strong name. Good strong job.</font>

932
01:00:18,241 --> 01:00:23,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thomas, here, is an accountant
for the Roxxon Oil Corporation.</font>

933
01:00:26,124 --> 01:00:28,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm sure he's a really good guy.</font>

934
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:32,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to shoot him in the head,</font>

935
01:00:32,714 --> 01:00:35,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">live on your television, in 30 seconds.</font>

936
01:00:35,717 --> 01:00:36,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

937
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:40,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The number for this telephone
is in your cell phone.</font>

938
01:00:40,388 --> 01:00:43,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exciting, isn't it,
imagining how it got there?</font>

939
01:00:43,725 --> 01:00:45,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">America,</font>

940
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:48,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if your president calls me
in the next half-minute,</font>

941
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:50,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom lives.</font>

942
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

943
01:00:53,735 --> 01:00:55,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did he hack my phone?</font>

944
01:00:55,111 --> 01:00:57,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't allow terrorists to dictate...</font>

945
01:00:57,155 --> 01:00:58,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to make this call.</font>

946
01:00:58,573 --> 01:00:59,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd strongly advise against that.</font>

947
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:02,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the right thing to do.</font>

948
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:31,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's just one lesson left,
President Ellis.</font>

949
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:33,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So run away, hide,
kiss your children goodbye.</font>

950
01:01:33,608 --> 01:01:34,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because nothing,</font>

951
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:37,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not your army, not your red, white
and blue attack dog,</font>

952
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:39,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can save you.</font>

953
01:01:41,574 --> 01:01:43,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you soon.</font>

954
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:49,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell Rhodes,
find this lunatic right now.</font>

955
01:01:49,207 --> 01:01:50,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal.</font>

956
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a possible point of origin
in Pakistan</font>

957
01:01:52,919 --> 01:01:54,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the Patriot is ready to strike.</font>

958
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:56,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right now.
- Yes, sir.</font>

959
01:02:09,227 --> 01:02:12,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man. Happy, Happy, Happy-</font>

960
01:02:26,577 --> 01:02:28,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move!</font>

961
01:02:34,502 --> 01:02:35,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on a second.</font>

962
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:37,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

963
01:02:37,547 --> 01:02:39,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ever have a chick straddling you,
and you look up</font>

964
01:02:39,298 --> 01:02:43,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and suddenly she's glowing from
the inside out, kind of a bright orange?</font>

965
01:02:43,428 --> 01:02:44,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?</font>

966
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:45,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's me, pal.</font>

967
01:02:45,847 --> 01:02:47,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, last time I went missing,
if I remember correctly,</font>

968
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:50,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you came looking for me.
What are you doing?</font>

969
01:02:50,101 --> 01:02:51,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little knock-and-talk,
making friends in Pakistan.</font>

970
01:02:51,561 --> 01:02:52,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

971
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:55,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your redesign, your big rebrand,
that was AIM, right?</font>

972
01:02:55,857 --> 01:02:56,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

973
01:02:58,568 --> 01:03:00,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna find a heavy-duty
comm sat right now, I need your login.</font>

974
01:03:01,112 --> 01:03:03,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the same as it's always been,
"WarMachine68."</font>

975
01:03:03,322 --> 01:03:04,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And password, please.</font>

976
01:03:04,365 --> 01:03:06,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I gotta change it
every time you hack in, Tony.</font>

977
01:03:06,576 --> 01:03:08,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not the 80s,
nobody says "hack" any more.</font>

978
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:09,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me your login.</font>

979
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:13,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"WAR MACHINE ROX"
with an "X," all caps.</font>

980
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:18,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, okay.</font>

981
01:03:18,963 --> 01:03:22,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is so much better
than "lron Patriot."</font>

982
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:31,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very nice. Very nice.</font>

983
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:34,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have one question for you.</font>

984
01:03:34,604 --> 01:03:37,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would you like
for Christmas this year?</font>

985
01:03:38,858 --> 01:03:40,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, David...</font>

986
01:03:42,487 --> 01:03:47,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not erase a programme from
my DVR unless you are 100% sure...</font>

987
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One more time!
Ms. Elk Ridge, everybody! All right.</font>

988
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:59,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you erase my shows!</font>

989
01:04:03,508 --> 01:04:05,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That ain't gonna cut it.</font>

990
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:07,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We talked about this.</font>

991
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:10,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, sir. I don't know who...</font>

992
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:15,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, I need to call you back.
Something magical is happening.</font>

993
01:04:17,146 --> 01:04:19,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tony Stark is in my van.
- Keep it down.</font>

994
01:04:19,148 --> 01:04:20,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tony Stark is in my van!
- No, he's not.</font>

995
01:04:20,816 --> 01:04:21,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew you were still alive!</font>

996
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:23,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on in. Close the door.</font>

997
01:04:28,533 --> 01:04:29,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. Can I just say, sir...</font>

998
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:30,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep.</font>

999
01:04:31,744 --> 01:04:32,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am your biggest fan.</font>

1000
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:34,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First, is this your van?
Is anyone else gonna come in?</font>

1001
01:04:35,248 --> 01:04:36,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. Just us.</font>

1002
01:04:36,374 --> 01:04:37,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great. What's your name?</font>

1003
01:04:37,542 --> 01:04:39,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Gary
- Gary</font>

1004
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:42,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wow.
- Right there is fine.</font>

1005
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Okay?</font>

1006
01:04:43,631 --> 01:04:44,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get a lot of this, it's okay.</font>

1007
01:04:45,174 --> 01:04:47,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good. Can I just say?
- What do you want? Yeah.</font>

1008
01:04:47,969 --> 01:04:49,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know if you can tell,</font>

1009
01:04:49,763 --> 01:04:52,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I have patterned
my whole look after you.</font>

1010
01:04:52,974 --> 01:04:54,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My hair's a little...
- it's fine.</font>

1011
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:55,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not right,
'cause there's no product in it.</font>

1012
01:04:56,143 --> 01:04:57,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

1013
01:04:58,104 --> 01:05:01,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to make things awkward
for you, but I do have to show you...</font>

1014
01:05:02,233 --> 01:05:03,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boom!</font>

1015
01:05:03,985 --> 01:05:06,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A Hispanic Scott Baio.</font>

1016
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:09,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry. Is that me?
- Yeah. It's... I mean...</font>

1017
01:05:09,532 --> 01:05:14,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had them do it off a doll that I made,
so it's not like it's off a picture.</font>

1018
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:17,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So it's a little bit...
- Gary. Listen to me, okay?</font>

1019
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:21,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to clip your wings, here.
We're both a little over-excited.</font>

1020
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys.</font>

1021
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:26,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying to grab a little something
from some hard-crypt data files.</font>

1022
01:05:26,716 --> 01:05:27,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have enough juice.</font>

1023
01:05:28,134 --> 01:05:30,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to jump on the roof...
Right?</font>

1024
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:32,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Recalibrate the lSDNs.</font>

1025
01:05:32,638 --> 01:05:34,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pump it up by about 40%.</font>

1026
01:05:35,141 --> 01:05:36,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Got it.
- All right? It's a mission.</font>

1027
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:37,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1028
01:05:37,435 --> 01:05:39,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony needs Gary.</font>

1029
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Gary needs Tony.</font>

1030
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:42,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Be quiet about it. Go.
- Yeah.</font>

1031
01:06:05,463 --> 01:06:09,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would you regard
as the defining moment of your life?</font>

1032
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:12,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think that would be the day
I decided not to let my injury beat me.</font>

1033
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:16,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you please state your name
for the camera?</font>

1034
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:17,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellen Brandt.</font>

1035
01:06:18,225 --> 01:06:22,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. So, the injections
are administered periodically.</font>

1036
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Addiction will not be tolerated.</font>

1037
01:06:23,814 --> 01:06:26,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those who cannot regulate
will be out from the programme.</font>

1038
01:06:28,152 --> 01:06:30,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once misfits, cripples...</font>

1039
01:06:31,656 --> 01:06:34,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are the next iteration
of human evolution.</font>

1040
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:40,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody, before we start...</font>

1041
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:44,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise you, looking back at your life,
there will be nothing as bitter</font>

1042
01:06:44,293 --> 01:06:48,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as the memory of that glorious risk
you prudently elected to forego.</font>

1043
01:06:48,506 --> 01:06:50,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today is your glory-</font>

1044
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:51,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's begin.</font>

1045
01:07:02,645 --> 01:07:03,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta get out of here!
We gotta get out of here!</font>

1046
01:07:04,105 --> 01:07:05,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get her out!
Get them out of here!</font>

1047
01:07:12,446 --> 01:07:15,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A bomb is not a bomb
when it's a misfire.</font>

1048
01:07:17,243 --> 01:07:19,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The stuff doesn't always work.
Right, pal?</font>

1049
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's faulty,
but you found a buyer, didn't you?</font>

1050
01:07:22,373 --> 01:07:24,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sold it to the Mandarin.</font>

1051
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:27,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got you, pal.</font>

1052
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:31,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened?</font>

1053
01:07:32,341 --> 01:07:34,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fun fact.</font>

1054
01:07:34,385 --> 01:07:37,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before he built rockets for the Nazis,</font>

1055
01:07:38,013 --> 01:07:42,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the idealistic Wernher von Braun</font>

1056
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:44,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">dreamed of space travel.</font>

1057
01:07:45,604 --> 01:07:47,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He stargazed.</font>

1058
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:51,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what he said
when the first V-2 hit London?</font>

1059
01:07:52,278 --> 01:07:55,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The rocket performed perfectly.</font>

1060
01:07:57,658 --> 01:08:00,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"It just landed on the wrong planet."</font>

1061
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:06,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, we all begin wide-eyed.
Pure science.</font>

1062
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:11,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then the ego steps in,
the obsession.</font>

1063
01:08:12,715 --> 01:08:14,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you look up,</font>

1064
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:19,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're a long way from shore.</font>

1065
01:08:19,472 --> 01:08:22,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't be too hard on yourself,
Maya.</font>

1066
01:08:23,017 --> 01:08:25,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you gave your research
to a think tank.</font>

1067
01:08:25,644 --> 01:08:29,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but Killian built that think tank
on military contracts.</font>

1068
01:08:29,482 --> 01:08:31,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's exactly what we used to do.</font>

1069
01:08:32,067 --> 01:08:34,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, don't judge yourself.</font>

1070
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:37,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Pepper.</font>

1071
01:08:38,824 --> 01:08:40,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really appreciate that.</font>

1072
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:50,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi, good evening. Come on in.
- Good evening.</font>

1073
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:53,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maya, run!</font>

1074
01:08:56,258 --> 01:08:57,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Pepper.</font>

1075
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:01,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you want to tell me why you
were at Stark's mansion last night?</font>

1076
01:09:01,806 --> 01:09:02,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying to fix this thing.</font>

1077
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:05,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know you and the master
were gonna blow the place up.</font>

1078
01:09:05,267 --> 01:09:08,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see. So, you were trying
to save Stark, when he threatened us?</font>

1079
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:10,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've told you, Killian, we can use him.</font>

1080
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:14,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.</font>

1081
01:09:14,777 --> 01:09:17,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, if we want to launch product
next year, I need Stark.</font>

1082
01:09:17,822 --> 01:09:21,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just lacked a decent incentive.
Now, he has one.</font>

1083
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:27,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is support team Blue-Zero.</font>

1084
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:30,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sending coordinates for a suspected
Mandarin broadcast point of origin.</font>

1085
01:09:30,869 --> 01:09:31,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Copy-</font>

1086
01:09:39,927 --> 01:09:41,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody move.</font>

1087
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:47,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Support Blue-Zero,</font>

1088
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:49,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">unless the Mandarin's next attack
on the U.S.</font>

1090
01:09:51,188 --> 01:09:53,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you messed up again.</font>

1091
01:09:53,524 --> 01:09:56,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you're free, if you weren't before.</font>

1092
01:09:56,652 --> 01:09:57,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's... Of course.</font>

1093
01:09:57,778 --> 01:09:58,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am.</font>

1094
01:09:58,946 --> 01:09:59,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iron Patriot on the job.</font>

1095
01:10:00,155 --> 01:10:01,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy to help.</font>

1096
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:02,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No need to thank me, ma'am.</font>

1097
01:10:02,616 --> 01:10:03,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my pleasure.</font>

1098
01:10:11,959 --> 01:10:14,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Savin?
I've acquired the Patriot armour.</font>

1099
01:10:14,295 --> 01:10:15,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want this suit,</font>

1100
01:10:15,713 --> 01:10:17,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're going to have to
pry my cold dead body out of it.</font>

1101
01:10:18,299 --> 01:10:19,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the plan, Colonel.</font>

1102
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:23,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harley, tell me what's happening.
Give me a full report.</font>

1103
01:10:24,013 --> 01:10:27,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm still eating that candy.
Do you want me to keep eating it?</font>

1104
01:10:27,641 --> 01:10:29,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How much have you had?
- Two or three bowls.</font>

1105
01:10:29,518 --> 01:10:32,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can you still see straight?
- Sort of.</font>

1106
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:33,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That means you're fine.
Give me Jarvis.</font>

1107
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:35,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis, how are we?</font>

1108
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:37,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's totally fine, sir.
I seem to do quite well for a stretch,</font>

1109
01:10:37,818 --> 01:10:40,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then at the end of the sentence,
I say the wrong cranberry.</font>

1110
01:10:40,946 --> 01:10:42,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, sir, you were right.</font>

1111
01:10:42,323 --> 01:10:44,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once I factored in
available AIM downlink facilities</font>

1112
01:10:45,326 --> 01:10:47,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was able to pinpoint
the Mandarin's broadcast signal.</font>

1113
01:10:47,828 --> 01:10:49,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are we talking?
Far East, Europe, North Africa...</font>

1114
01:10:49,997 --> 01:10:51,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?</font>

1115
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:53,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, sir, it's in Miami.</font>

1116
01:10:53,918 --> 01:10:56,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, kid, I'm gonna have
to walk you through</font>

1117
01:10:56,503 --> 01:10:57,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">rebooting Jarvis's speech drive,</font>

1118
01:10:57,963 --> 01:10:59,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but not right now.</font>

1119
01:10:59,465 --> 01:11:00,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harley, where is he really?</font>

1120
01:11:00,716 --> 01:11:02,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just look on the screen
and tell me where it is.</font>

1121
01:11:04,219 --> 01:11:06,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It does say Miami, Florida.</font>

1122
01:11:06,305 --> 01:11:09,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, first things first, I need
the armour. Where are we at with it?</font>

1123
01:11:09,558 --> 01:11:10,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not charging.</font>

1124
01:11:18,192 --> 01:11:21,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, sir, it is charging,
but the power source is questionable.</font>

1125
01:11:21,528 --> 01:11:23,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It may not succeed
in revitalising the Mark 42.</font>

1126
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:25,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's questionable about electricity?
All right?</font>

1127
01:11:25,908 --> 01:11:29,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my suit, and I can't...
I'm not gonna... I don't wanna...</font>

1128
01:11:30,579 --> 01:11:31,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, not again.</font>

1129
01:11:32,039 --> 01:11:33,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony?</font>

1130
01:11:35,751 --> 01:11:37,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you having another attack?</font>

1131
01:11:37,753 --> 01:11:38,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't even mention New York.</font>

1132
01:11:39,046 --> 01:11:42,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, and then you just said it by name
while denying having said it.</font>

1133
01:11:42,925 --> 01:11:44,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay...</font>

1134
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:47,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, what am I gonna do?</font>

1135
01:11:47,972 --> 01:11:51,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just breathe. Really, just breathe.</font>

1136
01:11:51,809 --> 01:11:54,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a mechanic, right?</font>

1137
01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:55,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

1138
01:11:56,563 --> 01:11:57,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said so.</font>

1139
01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:00,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I did.</font>

1140
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:03,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you just build something?</font>

1141
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:16,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1142
01:12:17,501 --> 01:12:18,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, kid.</font>

1143
01:14:02,272 --> 01:14:07,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is it so hot in here?
I told you to put it at 68.</font>

1144
01:14:07,361 --> 01:14:08,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My fault again.</font>

1145
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:11,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me tell you something, sweetheart.
I am not your personal air con...</font>

1146
01:15:11,884 --> 01:15:12,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well.</font>

1147
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:16,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes.</font>

1148
01:15:18,056 --> 01:15:20,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, which one of you is Vanessa?</font>

1149
01:15:20,475 --> 01:15:21,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's me.</font>

1150
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:23,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nessie.</font>

1151
01:15:23,729 --> 01:15:28,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you know that fortune cookies
aren't even Chinese?</font>

1152
01:15:28,734 --> 01:15:30,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's some guy over here.</font>

1153
01:15:30,235 --> 01:15:33,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're made by Americans,
based on a Japanese recipe.</font>

1154
01:15:33,697 --> 01:15:34,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1155
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:38,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bloody hell. Bloody hell.</font>

1156
01:15:38,452 --> 01:15:39,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move.</font>

1157
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:41,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not moving.
You want something? Take it.</font>

1158
01:15:41,788 --> 01:15:42,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Although the guns are all fake</font>

1159
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:44,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because those wankers
wouldn't trust me with the real ones.</font>

1160
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:47,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?</font>

1161
01:15:49,046 --> 01:15:50,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heard enough.</font>

1162
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not him.
The Mandarin, the real guy.</font>

1163
01:15:52,633 --> 01:15:53,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where?</font>

1164
01:15:53,759 --> 01:15:55,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?</font>

1165
01:15:56,428 --> 01:15:58,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's here.
He's here, but he's not here.</font>

1166
01:15:59,056 --> 01:16:00,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's here, but he's not here.
- What do you mean?</font>

1167
01:16:01,058 --> 01:16:02,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's complicated.
Hey, it's complicated.</font>

1168
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:04,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It is.
- It's complicated.</font>

1169
01:16:04,853 --> 01:16:06,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out.</font>

1170
01:16:06,146 --> 01:16:07,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of the bed.
Get into the bathroom.</font>

1171
01:16:10,442 --> 01:16:11,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit.</font>

1172
01:16:12,653 --> 01:16:13,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Jesus.</font>

1173
01:16:20,869 --> 01:16:23,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.</font>

1174
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:25,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you?</font>

1175
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A decoy? You're a double, right?</font>

1176
01:16:28,085 --> 01:16:30,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean like an understudy?
No, absolutely not.</font>

1177
01:16:31,046 --> 01:16:33,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.</font>

1178
01:16:34,549 --> 01:16:36,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a minute to live.
Fill it with words.</font>

1179
01:16:36,802 --> 01:16:40,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a role.
"The Mandarin," it's not real.</font>

1180
01:16:41,139 --> 01:16:43,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then how did you get here, Trevor?</font>

1181
01:16:45,185 --> 01:16:51,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I had a little problem
with substances.</font>

1182
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:55,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I ended up doing things,
no two ways about it,</font>

1183
01:16:55,779 --> 01:16:58,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the street,
that a man shouldn't do.</font>

1184
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Next?
- Then,</font>

1185
01:16:59,783 --> 01:17:02,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they approached me
about the role,</font>

1186
01:17:02,744 --> 01:17:04,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they knew about the drugs.</font>

1187
01:17:04,246 --> 01:17:05,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did they say?
They'd get you off them?</font>

1188
01:17:05,747 --> 01:17:07,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They said they'd give me more.</font>

1189
01:17:07,291 --> 01:17:08,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They gave me things.</font>

1190
01:17:08,417 --> 01:17:11,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They gave me this palace.
They gave me plastic surgery.</font>

1191
01:17:12,004 --> 01:17:14,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They gave me things.</font>

1192
01:17:15,424 --> 01:17:16,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you just nod off?</font>

1193
01:17:16,717 --> 01:17:17,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1194
01:17:17,801 --> 01:17:19,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, and a lovely speedboat.</font>

1195
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the thing was, he needed someone</font>

1196
01:17:22,222 --> 01:17:26,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to take credit
for some accidental explosions.</font>

1197
01:17:29,563 --> 01:17:30,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"He"?</font>

1198
01:17:33,191 --> 01:17:35,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Killian?
- Killian.</font>

1199
01:17:35,235 --> 01:17:38,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He created you?
- He created me.</font>

1200
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:39,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Custom-made terror threat.</font>

1201
01:17:40,324 --> 01:17:42,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Yes.</font>

1202
01:17:42,284 --> 01:17:44,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His think tank thinked it up.</font>

1203
01:17:44,578 --> 01:17:46,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The pathology of a serial killer.</font>

1204
01:17:46,955 --> 01:17:49,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The manipulation
of Western iconography.</font>

1205
01:17:50,334 --> 01:17:53,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready for another lesson?</font>

1206
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:54,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blah, blah, blah.</font>

1207
01:17:55,255 --> 01:17:56,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1208
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:59,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, it was my performance
that brought the Mandarin to life.</font>

1209
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your performance?</font>

1210
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where people died?</font>

1211
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, they didn't.</font>

1212
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:08,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look around you.
The costumes, green screen.</font>

1213
01:18:09,061 --> 01:18:11,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honestly,
I wasn't on location for half this stuff.</font>

1214
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:13,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when I was,
it was movie magic, love.</font>

1215
01:18:13,357 --> 01:18:15,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, but I got a best friend
who's in a coma</font>

1216
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he might not wake up.</font>

1217
01:18:16,902 --> 01:18:17,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're gonna have
to answer for that.</font>

1218
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're still going down, pal.</font>

1219
01:18:19,654 --> 01:18:20,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You under...</font>

1220
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:30,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?</font>

1221
01:18:30,582 --> 01:18:32,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?</font>

1222
01:18:33,752 --> 01:18:34,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1223
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:36,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should have pressed
the panic button.</font>

1224
01:18:37,297 --> 01:18:39,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.</font>

1225
01:18:52,312 --> 01:18:53,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1226
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:03,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just like old times, huh?</font>

1227
01:19:04,366 --> 01:19:07,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.</font>

1228
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't my idea.</font>

1229
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:10,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. So you took Killian's card.</font>

1230
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:12,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took his money.</font>

1231
01:19:12,332 --> 01:19:14,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And here you are 13 years later,
in a dungeon.</font>

1232
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:16,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Yeah.</font>

1233
01:19:16,503 --> 01:19:18,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you're in a dungeon.
I'm free to go.</font>

1234
01:19:18,797 --> 01:19:20,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah?</font>

1235
01:19:23,969 --> 01:19:25,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot has happened, Tony.</font>

1236
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:27,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm close.</font>

1237
01:19:28,557 --> 01:19:30,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">EXTREMIS is practically stabilised.</font>

1238
01:19:30,767 --> 01:19:32,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm telling you it isn't.
I'm on the street.</font>

1239
01:19:33,019 --> 01:19:34,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People are going bang.
They're painting the walls.</font>

1240
01:19:34,521 --> 01:19:35,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maya, you're kidding yourself.</font>

1241
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:37,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then help me fix it.</font>

1242
01:19:42,571 --> 01:19:43,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I do that?</font>

1243
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:46,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1244
01:19:46,533 --> 01:19:47,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I remember the night, not the morning.</font>

1245
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:50,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this what
you've been chasing around?</font>

1246
01:19:50,287 --> 01:19:52,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.</font>

1247
01:19:53,373 --> 01:19:56,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You used to have a moral psychology.</font>

1248
01:19:57,043 --> 01:19:59,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You used to have ideals.</font>

1249
01:19:59,629 --> 01:20:01,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanted to help people.</font>

1250
01:20:02,048 --> 01:20:03,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now look at you.</font>

1251
01:20:04,968 --> 01:20:06,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get to wake up every morning
with someone who</font>

1252
01:20:10,223 --> 01:20:11,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">still has their soul.</font>

1253
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:18,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me out of here.</font>

1254
01:20:21,443 --> 01:20:22,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1255
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:25,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what my old man
used to say to me?</font>

1256
01:20:26,781 --> 01:20:29,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of his favourite of many sayings...</font>

1257
01:20:29,951 --> 01:20:34,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The early bird gets the worm,
but the second mouse gets the cheese."</font>

1258
01:20:34,539 --> 01:20:36,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not still pissed off
about the Switzerland thing, are you?</font>

1259
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:39,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can I be pissed at you, Tony?</font>

1260
01:20:39,252 --> 01:20:41,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here to thank you.</font>

1261
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:43,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gave me the greatest gift
that anybody's ever given me.</font>

1262
01:20:44,424 --> 01:20:45,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desperation.</font>

1263
01:20:46,426 --> 01:20:48,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you think back to Switzerland,</font>

1264
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:51,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you said you'd meet me
on the rooftop, right?</font>

1265
01:20:51,264 --> 01:20:54,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well for the first 20 minutes,</font>

1266
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:56,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I actually thought you'd show up.</font>

1267
01:20:56,645 --> 01:20:58,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the next hour...</font>

1268
01:21:00,023 --> 01:21:04,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I considered taking
that one-step shortcut to the lobby.</font>

1269
01:21:04,736 --> 01:21:05,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you know what I mean.</font>

1270
01:21:06,112 --> 01:21:09,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.</font>

1271
01:21:09,616 --> 01:21:11,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But as I looked out over that city,</font>

1272
01:21:12,118 --> 01:21:14,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">nobody knew I was there,
nobody could see me,</font>

1273
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:17,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no one was even looking.</font>

1274
01:21:17,207 --> 01:21:21,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a thought that would guide me
for years to come.</font>

1275
01:21:21,795 --> 01:21:23,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anonymity, Tony.</font>

1276
01:21:24,673 --> 01:21:26,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks to you,
it's been my mantra ever since.</font>

1277
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:27,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right?</font>

1278
01:21:27,717 --> 01:21:30,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You simply rule
from behind the scenes.</font>

1279
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:32,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because the second
you give evil a face,</font>

1280
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:35,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a Bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin,</font>

1281
01:21:35,809 --> 01:21:37,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you hand the people a target.</font>

1282
01:21:37,686 --> 01:21:39,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're something else.</font>

1283
01:21:41,398 --> 01:21:42,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have met him, I assume?</font>

1284
01:21:42,566 --> 01:21:44,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.</font>

1285
01:21:44,234 --> 01:21:46,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know he's a little
over the top sometimes.</font>

1286
01:21:46,653 --> 01:21:48,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not entirely my fault.
He has a tenden...</font>

1287
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:49,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a stage actor.</font>

1288
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:53,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They say his Lear was
the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.</font>

1289
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:55,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, the point is,</font>

1290
01:21:55,787 --> 01:21:59,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky,</font>

1291
01:21:59,207 --> 01:22:00,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">subtlety has kind of had its day.</font>

1292
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:02,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's next for you in your world?</font>

1293
01:22:02,836 --> 01:22:07,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to repay you the self same gift
that you so graciously imparted to me.</font>

1294
01:22:14,764 --> 01:22:15,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desperation.</font>

1295
01:22:16,725 --> 01:22:17,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this is live.</font>

1296
01:22:18,059 --> 01:22:21,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure if you can tell,
but at this moment</font>

1297
01:22:21,146 --> 01:22:25,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the body is trying to decide whether to
accept EXTREMIS, or just give up.</font>

1298
01:22:25,817 --> 01:22:27,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if it gives up,</font>

1299
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:32,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to say,
the detonation is quite spectacular.</font>

1300
01:22:33,491 --> 01:22:36,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But until that point,
it's really just a lot of pain.</font>

1301
01:22:38,705 --> 01:22:41,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We haven't even talked salary yet.</font>

1302
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:44,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?</font>

1303
01:22:45,086 --> 01:22:46,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let him go.</font>

1304
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:48,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, hold on.</font>

1305
01:22:49,341 --> 01:22:50,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maya...</font>

1306
01:22:50,592 --> 01:22:52,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said, let him go.</font>

1307
01:22:53,178 --> 01:22:54,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

1308
01:22:54,679 --> 01:22:57,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1200 CCs.
A dose half of this size, I'm dead.</font>

1309
01:22:58,266 --> 01:23:02,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.</font>

1310
01:23:02,562 --> 01:23:03,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maya, give me the injector.</font>

1311
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I die, Killian,</font>

1312
01:23:06,524 --> 01:23:09,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?</font>

1313
01:23:09,694 --> 01:23:10,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not doing this, okay?</font>

1314
01:23:11,112 --> 01:23:14,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happens to you?
What happens if you go too hot?</font>

1315
01:23:26,252 --> 01:23:27,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The good news is,</font>

1316
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:30,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a high-level position
has just been vacated.</font>

1317
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:41,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are a maniac.</font>

1318
01:23:41,643 --> 01:23:43,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm a visionary.</font>

1319
01:23:44,145 --> 01:23:46,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I do own a maniac.</font>

1320
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:49,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he takes the stage tonight.</font>

1321
01:23:53,113 --> 01:23:54,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once we get the Patriot installed,</font>

1322
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it will take me
9 or 10 minutes for the takedown.</font>

1323
01:23:57,325 --> 01:23:59,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's great, but the last time I looked,
there was somebody inside of it.</font>

1324
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:07,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Afternoon, gentlemen.</font>

1325
01:24:11,089 --> 01:24:12,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Colonel.</font>

1326
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:14,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Step aside.</font>

1327
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:25,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll get you out of there.</font>

1328
01:24:25,186 --> 01:24:26,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry.</font>

1329
01:24:27,021 --> 01:24:28,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll damage the armour.</font>

1330
01:24:28,982 --> 01:24:30,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I will.</font>

1331
01:24:30,984 --> 01:24:32,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you can fix it, right?</font>

1332
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:35,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna take the Chinook
to base camp.</font>

1333
01:24:35,822 --> 01:24:37,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I want Potts with me.</font>

1334
01:24:37,407 --> 01:24:38,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's still in Phase 2.</font>

1335
01:24:40,452 --> 01:24:41,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not going deaf, are you?</font>

1336
01:24:58,178 --> 01:25:00,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful, there. It's a limited edition.</font>

1337
01:25:01,097 --> 01:25:02,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Ponytail Express.</font>

1338
01:25:03,475 --> 01:25:05,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the mileage count
between Tennessee and Miami?</font>

1339
01:25:05,518 --> 01:25:06,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">832 miles.</font>

1340
01:25:06,811 --> 01:25:08,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very nice.</font>

1341
01:25:08,188 --> 01:25:09,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm good like that.</font>

1342
01:25:10,148 --> 01:25:11,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you stop that?</font>

1343
01:25:11,775 --> 01:25:13,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Break it, you bought it.</font>

1344
01:25:15,612 --> 01:25:16,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I bought it.</font>

1345
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:19,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, that wasn't mine to give away.
That belongs to my friend's sister.</font>

1346
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's why
I'm gonna kill you first.</font>

1347
01:25:22,577 --> 01:25:23,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you gonna do to me?
- You'll see.</font>

1348
01:25:24,078 --> 01:25:25,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're zip-tied to a bed.</font>

1349
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:27,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This.</font>

1350
01:25:30,919 --> 01:25:31,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That.</font>

1351
01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:38,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you coming out?</font>

1352
01:25:41,095 --> 01:25:43,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not open. Do not open.
Don't open. Don't open.</font>

1353
01:25:43,473 --> 01:25:44,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Let's go.</font>

1354
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:54,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You... You breathe fire? Okay.</font>

1355
01:25:59,405 --> 01:26:02,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a glorious day, Savin.</font>

1356
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This time tomorrow,</font>

1357
01:26:04,244 --> 01:26:07,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll have the West's
most powerful leader in one hand,</font>

1358
01:26:07,914 --> 01:26:11,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the world's most feared terrorist
in the other.</font>

1359
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:14,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll own the war on terror.</font>

1360
01:26:15,547 --> 01:26:16,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Create supply and demand.</font>

1361
01:26:17,549 --> 01:26:21,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For you, for your brothers and sisters.</font>

1362
01:26:23,638 --> 01:26:25,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me,
you're gonna be in a puddle of blood</font>

1363
01:26:25,765 --> 01:26:28,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the ground in 5, 4, 3...</font>

1364
01:26:28,268 --> 01:26:29,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! 2...</font>

1365
01:26:31,271 --> 01:26:32,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did we get this shift?</font>

1366
01:26:32,772 --> 01:26:34,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right,
I'm gonna give you a chance to escape.</font>

1367
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:36,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put down your weapons.</font>

1368
01:26:36,109 --> 01:26:38,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tie yourselves to those chairs.
I'll let you live.</font>

1369
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:40,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In 5, 4, bang!</font>

1370
01:26:41,114 --> 01:26:42,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

1371
01:26:42,323 --> 01:26:44,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should be gone by now.
You should've already been gone.</font>

1372
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:45,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am just beyond terrified.</font>

1373
01:26:45,827 --> 01:26:47,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here it comes.</font>

1374
01:26:47,579 --> 01:26:49,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 3, 4...
- Shut up.</font>

1375
01:26:49,998 --> 01:26:51,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5, 4, 3, 2, 1!</font>

1376
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Told you.</font>

1377
01:27:05,722 --> 01:27:06,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the rest?</font>

1378
01:28:05,865 --> 01:28:08,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honestly,
I hate working here. They are so weird.</font>

1379
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:16,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better late than never.</font>

1380
01:28:22,048 --> 01:28:24,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not this time. Not the face.</font>

1381
01:28:25,718 --> 01:28:27,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good to be back.
Hello, by the way.</font>

1382
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, sir.</font>

1383
01:28:34,268 --> 01:28:36,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All personnel, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.</font>

1384
01:28:37,021 --> 01:28:39,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Repeat, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.</font>

1385
01:28:39,691 --> 01:28:40,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!</font>

1386
01:28:41,317 --> 01:28:42,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crap.</font>

1387
01:28:55,373 --> 01:28:56,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony?</font>

1388
01:28:56,582 --> 01:28:57,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rhodey, tell me
that was you in the suit.</font>

1389
01:28:57,917 --> 01:28:59,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You got yours?</font>

1390
01:29:00,253 --> 01:29:02,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kind of.
Main house, as fast as you can.</font>

1391
01:29:02,505 --> 01:29:04,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's somebody I'd like you to meet.</font>

1392
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:11,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, you, you! Move! Get out!</font>

1393
01:29:11,764 --> 01:29:14,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The room is secure.
I have eyes on the Mandarin.</font>

1394
01:29:14,225 --> 01:29:15,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's this? I had winners.</font>

1395
01:29:23,651 --> 01:29:24,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have you come as?</font>

1396
01:29:25,111 --> 01:29:27,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You make a move,
and I break your face.</font>

1397
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:32,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.</font>

1398
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:33,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the Mandarin?</font>

1399
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:35,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know, it's...
It's embarrassing.</font>

1400
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.</font>

1401
01:29:37,999 --> 01:29:40,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.</font>

1402
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, hey, if you're here to arrest me,
there's some people I'd like to roll on.</font>

1403
01:29:44,797 --> 01:29:46,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.</font>

1404
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:48,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tell him where Pepper is
and he'll stop doing it.</font>

1405
01:29:48,634 --> 01:29:50,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doing what?</font>

1406
01:29:50,178 --> 01:29:52,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get it! That hurt. I get it! I get it!</font>

1407
01:29:52,889 --> 01:29:56,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know about any Pepper,
but I know about the plan.</font>

1408
01:29:56,434 --> 01:29:58,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Spill.
- Do you know what they did to my suit?</font>

1409
01:29:58,478 --> 01:29:59,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No.</font>

1410
01:29:59,979 --> 01:30:02,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I do know it's happening
off the coast.</font>

1411
01:30:02,148 --> 01:30:05,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something to do with a big boat.</font>

1412
01:30:05,651 --> 01:30:06,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can take you there.</font>

1413
01:30:07,653 --> 01:30:09,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ole', ole', ole', ole'...</font>

1414
01:30:09,614 --> 01:30:12,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow his face off.</font>

1415
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:16,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this next bit may include
the vice president as well.</font>

1416
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:18,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that...
Is that important?</font>

1417
01:30:18,664 --> 01:30:20,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Somewhat.
- Yeah, a little bit.</font>

1418
01:30:23,127 --> 01:30:24,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So?</font>

1419
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:26,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are we gonna do?</font>

1420
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't have any transport.</font>

1421
01:30:27,298 --> 01:30:28,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

1422
01:30:30,176 --> 01:30:31,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Ringo.</font>

1423
01:30:31,385 --> 01:30:34,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?</font>

1424
01:30:36,224 --> 01:30:38,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.</font>

1425
01:30:38,893 --> 01:30:39,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we also have to figure out</font>

1426
01:30:40,019 --> 01:30:41,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- this vice president thing, right?
- Right.</font>

1427
01:30:41,854 --> 01:30:43,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wonder who I'm calling right now.</font>

1428
01:30:43,147 --> 01:30:44,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the vice president.</font>

1429
01:30:44,398 --> 01:30:45,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

1430
01:30:46,317 --> 01:30:47,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

1431
01:30:47,527 --> 01:30:49,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, this is Tony Stark.</font>

1432
01:30:49,529 --> 01:30:51,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome back to the land of the living.</font>

1433
01:30:51,322 --> 01:30:53,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign.</font>

1434
01:30:53,574 --> 01:30:55,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.</font>

1435
01:30:55,535 --> 01:30:57,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stark, I'm about
to eat honey-roast ham,</font>

1436
01:30:57,995 --> 01:31:00,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">surrounded by the Agency's finest.</font>

1437
01:31:00,331 --> 01:31:03,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The president's safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.</font>

1438
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:04,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we're good, here.</font>

1439
01:31:04,836 --> 01:31:06,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.</font>

1440
01:31:07,213 --> 01:31:08,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.</font>

1441
01:31:09,215 --> 01:31:10,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're gonna take out
the president somehow.</font>

1442
01:31:10,842 --> 01:31:12,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to immediately
alert that plane.</font>

1443
01:31:12,552 --> 01:31:14,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.</font>

1444
01:31:14,679 --> 01:31:17,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.</font>

1445
01:31:17,765 --> 01:31:19,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you, Colonel.
- Rhodes and Stark out.</font>

1446
01:31:21,102 --> 01:31:22,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything okay, sir?</font>

1447
01:31:23,813 --> 01:31:24,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Couldn't be better.</font>

1448
01:31:31,779 --> 01:31:33,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, babe.</font>

1449
01:31:53,843 --> 01:31:55,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel Rhodes.</font>

1450
01:31:55,428 --> 01:31:58,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.</font>

1451
01:32:03,603 --> 01:32:04,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta make a decision.</font>

1452
01:32:04,812 --> 01:32:07,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.</font>

1453
01:32:07,773 --> 01:32:09,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I have an update from Malibu.</font>

1454
01:32:09,483 --> 01:32:11,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The cranes have finally arrived,</font>

1455
01:32:11,777 --> 01:32:13,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the cellar doors
are being cleared as we speak.</font>

1456
01:32:13,821 --> 01:32:15,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what about the suit I'm wearing?</font>

1457
01:32:15,698 --> 01:32:17,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The armour is now at 92%.</font>

1458
01:32:18,034 --> 01:32:20,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's going to have to do.</font>

1459
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:30,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here he comes. Here he comes.
Get a quick picture.</font>

1460
01:32:30,338 --> 01:32:31,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

1461
01:32:48,689 --> 01:32:49,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything all right, Colonel?</font>

1462
01:33:22,682 --> 01:33:24,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is an honour, Mr. President.</font>

1463
01:33:25,101 --> 01:33:27,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're gonna do it, do it!</font>

1464
01:33:27,687 --> 01:33:29,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool your boots, sir.</font>

1465
01:33:29,522 --> 01:33:31,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not how the Mandarin works.</font>

1466
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:33,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, Air Force One
has been compromised.</font>

1467
01:33:33,693 --> 01:33:35,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Internal shots, temperature spikes.</font>

1468
01:33:35,695 --> 01:33:36,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me eyes on it now.</font>

1469
01:33:37,238 --> 01:33:39,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Image coming through now, sir.</font>

1470
01:33:41,575 --> 01:33:43,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was that Rhodes?</font>

1471
01:33:52,503 --> 01:33:53,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is anyone there?</font>

1472
01:33:54,213 --> 01:33:55,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let us out!</font>

1473
01:34:12,356 --> 01:34:13,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The President.</font>

1474
01:34:14,358 --> 01:34:15,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now.</font>

1475
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:16,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not here.</font>

1476
01:34:20,781 --> 01:34:22,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try the jet stream?</font>

1477
01:34:23,701 --> 01:34:25,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speaking of which, go fish.</font>

1478
01:34:48,309 --> 01:34:50,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.</font>

1479
01:35:03,282 --> 01:35:04,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many in the air?</font>

1480
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:05,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">13, sir.</font>

1481
01:35:07,912 --> 01:35:09,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How many can I carry?
- 4, sir.</font>

1482
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:22,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slow down. Slow down, relax.
What's your name? Heather?</font>

1483
01:35:28,057 --> 01:35:30,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God! No! No!</font>

1484
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:33,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to me. See that guy?</font>

1485
01:35:33,646 --> 01:35:35,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna swing by,
you're just gonna grab him.</font>

1486
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got it?
- What?</font>

1487
01:35:39,568 --> 01:35:42,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll electrify your arm,
you won't be able to open your hand.</font>

1488
01:35:44,115 --> 01:35:45,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can do this, Heather.</font>

1489
01:35:54,208 --> 01:35:56,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy, see? 11 more to go.</font>

1490
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember that game
called Barrel of Monkeys?</font>

1491
01:36:02,007 --> 01:36:03,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what we're going to do.</font>

1492
01:36:03,175 --> 01:36:04,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">18,000 feet.</font>

1493
01:36:04,510 --> 01:36:05,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, people.
Everybody, grab your monkey.</font>

1494
01:36:10,975 --> 01:36:12,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice.</font>

1495
01:36:12,601 --> 01:36:14,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10,000 feet.</font>

1496
01:36:17,606 --> 01:36:18,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6,000 feet.</font>

1497
01:36:19,024 --> 01:36:20,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, people.</font>

1498
01:36:21,527 --> 01:36:22,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on, come on!</font>

1499
01:36:26,031 --> 01:36:27,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

1500
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:29,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1,000 feet.</font>

1501
01:36:30,244 --> 01:36:31,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">400 feet.</font>

1502
01:36:32,413 --> 01:36:33,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">200 feet, sir.</font>

1503
01:36:33,706 --> 01:36:34,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a chunky monkey, let's get him.</font>

1504
01:36:35,875 --> 01:36:37,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

1505
01:36:58,397 --> 01:36:59,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We made it!</font>

1506
01:37:00,232 --> 01:37:01,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice work, guys!</font>

1507
01:37:01,775 --> 01:37:04,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excellent.
Good team effort all around. Go us.</font>

1508
01:37:04,695 --> 01:37:05,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Jarvis.</font>

1509
01:37:05,863 --> 01:37:07,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's only half-done.
We've still got to get Pepper...</font>

1510
01:37:15,289 --> 01:37:16,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That came out of nowhere.</font>

1511
01:37:16,957 --> 01:37:18,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

1512
01:37:18,584 --> 01:37:19,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me some good news, man.</font>

1513
01:37:19,793 --> 01:37:20,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think they all made it.</font>

1514
01:37:20,878 --> 01:37:21,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank God.</font>

1515
01:37:21,921 --> 01:37:22,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but I missed the president.</font>

1516
01:37:23,422 --> 01:37:25,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You couldn't save the president
with the suit,</font>

1517
01:37:25,382 --> 01:37:27,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how are we gonna save Pepper
with nothing?</font>

1518
01:37:27,593 --> 01:37:29,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say, Jarvis, is it that time?</font>

1519
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:31,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The House Party Protocol, sir?</font>

1520
01:37:31,722 --> 01:37:32,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Correct.</font>

1521
01:38:03,128 --> 01:38:04,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

1522
01:38:11,971 --> 01:38:14,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think he's gonna help you?</font>

1523
01:38:14,974 --> 01:38:16,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won't.</font>

1524
01:38:20,854 --> 01:38:24,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Having you here is not
just to motivate Tony Stark. It's...</font>

1525
01:38:25,234 --> 01:38:27,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's actually
more embarrassing than that.</font>

1526
01:38:28,028 --> 01:38:30,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're here as my...</font>

1527
01:38:31,156 --> 01:38:32,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">trophy-</font>

1528
01:38:45,296 --> 01:38:46,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good evening, sir.</font>

1529
01:38:51,176 --> 01:38:53,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome aboard, Mr. President.</font>

1530
01:39:02,438 --> 01:39:04,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ever hear of an elephant graveyard?</font>

1531
01:39:04,189 --> 01:39:08,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, 2 years ago,
the elephant in the room was this scow.</font>

1532
01:39:11,238 --> 01:39:12,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the Roxxon Norco.</font>

1533
01:39:12,615 --> 01:39:13,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, of course, you'll remember</font>

1534
01:39:13,699 --> 01:39:16,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that when she spilled a million gallons
of crude off Pensacola,</font>

1535
01:39:16,619 --> 01:39:19,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">thanks to you,
not one fat cat saw a day in court.</font>

1536
01:39:19,788 --> 01:39:21,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want from me?</font>

1537
01:39:22,499 --> 01:39:23,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing, sir.</font>

1538
01:39:24,126 --> 01:39:27,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.</font>

1539
01:39:27,671 --> 01:39:29,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, I've moved on.</font>

1540
01:39:29,798 --> 01:39:32,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found myself a new political patron,</font>

1541
01:39:32,593 --> 01:39:35,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and this time tomorrow,
he'll have your job.</font>

1542
01:39:36,388 --> 01:39:38,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">String him up.</font>

1543
01:39:39,725 --> 01:39:40,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1544
01:39:56,992 --> 01:39:58,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1545
01:40:02,122 --> 01:40:04,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not gonna freak out on me,
right?</font>

1546
01:40:04,124 --> 01:40:05,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope not.</font>

1547
01:40:30,484 --> 01:40:32,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1548
01:40:33,946 --> 01:40:36,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's strung up over the oil tanker.
They're gonna light him up, man.</font>

1549
01:40:36,156 --> 01:40:38,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Viking funeral.
Public execution.</font>

1550
01:40:38,826 --> 01:40:40,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, death by oil.</font>

1551
01:40:46,792 --> 01:40:49,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Broadcast will commence shortly.
Take final positions.</font>

1552
01:40:51,296 --> 01:40:52,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. That's good.</font>

1553
01:40:52,506 --> 01:40:56,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now give me cameras A through E
and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.</font>

1554
01:40:57,511 --> 01:40:58,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is your gun up?</font>

1555
01:40:58,846 --> 01:41:00,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep. What do I do?</font>

1556
01:41:00,514 --> 01:41:02,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay on my 6, cover high
and don't shoot me in the back.</font>

1557
01:41:03,142 --> 01:41:05,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6, high, back. All right.</font>

1558
01:41:14,236 --> 01:41:15,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see that? Nailed it.</font>

1559
01:41:16,155 --> 01:41:17,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you really killed the glass.</font>

1560
01:41:17,573 --> 01:41:18,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think I was aiming for the bulb?</font>

1561
01:41:18,741 --> 01:41:19,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't hit a bulb at this distance.</font>

1562
01:41:21,452 --> 01:41:22,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All personnel, we have hostiles</font>

1563
01:41:22,995 --> 01:41:24,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- on east unit 12.
- Over there!</font>

1564
01:41:24,246 --> 01:41:25,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.
- I'm out. Give me...</font>

1565
01:41:25,914 --> 01:41:28,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got extra magazines?
- They're not universal, Tony.</font>

1566
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:30,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Give me another one.</font>

1567
01:41:30,502 --> 01:41:31,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- One of yours.
- I don't have one that fits that gun.</font>

1568
01:41:31,879 --> 01:41:32,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got, like, 5 of them.</font>

1569
01:41:33,046 --> 01:41:34,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's what I'm going to do.</font>

1570
01:41:34,423 --> 01:41:36,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Save my spot, ready?</font>

1571
01:41:36,383 --> 01:41:39,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What'd you see?
- Too fast. Nothing.</font>

1572
01:41:39,261 --> 01:41:40,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>

1573
01:41:44,516 --> 01:41:46,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 guys, one girl, all armed.</font>

1574
01:41:56,445 --> 01:41:57,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I would kill
for some armour right now.</font>

1575
01:41:58,071 --> 01:42:00,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're right. We need backup.
- Yeah, a bunch.</font>

1576
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:02,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?</font>

1577
01:42:06,789 --> 01:42:07,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that...</font>

1578
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep-</font>

1579
01:42:09,917 --> 01:42:11,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are those...
- Yeah.</font>

1580
01:42:28,227 --> 01:42:29,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Merry Christmas, buddy.</font>

1581
01:42:34,817 --> 01:42:37,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis, target
EXTREMIS heat signatures.</font>

1582
01:42:37,569 --> 01:42:39,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Disable with extreme prejudice.</font>

1583
01:42:39,905 --> 01:42:40,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

1584
01:42:44,910 --> 01:42:47,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you waiting for?
It's Christmas.</font>

1585
01:42:49,289 --> 01:42:50,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take them to church.</font>

1586
01:42:57,422 --> 01:42:59,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen.</font>

1587
01:43:06,348 --> 01:43:07,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Incoming!</font>

1588
01:43:11,979 --> 01:43:13,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.</font>

1589
01:43:26,618 --> 01:43:28,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is how you've been managing
your down time, huh?</font>

1590
01:43:28,704 --> 01:43:29,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody needs a hobby.</font>

1591
01:43:36,295 --> 01:43:37,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out,
will you?</font>

1592
01:44:06,241 --> 01:44:07,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice timing.</font>

1593
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:10,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. That's awesome.
Give me a suit, okay?</font>

1594
01:44:11,496 --> 01:44:13,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.</font>

1595
01:44:13,665 --> 01:44:15,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What does that mean?
- I got you covered.</font>

1596
01:44:18,879 --> 01:44:21,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good evening, Colonel.
Can I give you a lift?</font>

1597
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:22,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very funny.</font>

1598
01:44:39,858 --> 01:44:41,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I've located Ms. Potts.</font>

1599
01:44:41,234 --> 01:44:42,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About time.</font>

1600
01:44:55,248 --> 01:44:59,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!
Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.</font>

1601
01:45:00,754 --> 01:45:04,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See what happens when you hang out
with my ex-girlfriends?</font>

1602
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:06,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're such a jerk.</font>

1603
01:45:06,969 --> 01:45:08,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.</font>

1604
01:45:10,806 --> 01:45:12,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. A little more, baby.</font>

1605
01:45:28,573 --> 01:45:29,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this guy bothering you?</font>

1606
01:45:31,410 --> 01:45:32,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't get up.</font>

1607
01:45:37,416 --> 01:45:38,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it hot in there?</font>

1608
01:45:40,836 --> 01:45:42,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck?</font>

1609
01:45:43,296 --> 01:45:46,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a little turtle,
cooking in his little turtle suit.</font>

1610
01:45:46,925 --> 01:45:47,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony.</font>

1611
01:45:48,885 --> 01:45:50,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's watching.</font>

1612
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:52,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you should close your eyes.</font>

1613
01:45:53,432 --> 01:45:54,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close your eyes.</font>

1614
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close your eyes.
You don't want to see this.</font>

1615
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:06,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you take a minute.</font>

1616
01:46:39,311 --> 01:46:41,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis, give me a suit right now!</font>

1617
01:46:52,574 --> 01:46:53,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

1618
01:46:55,494 --> 01:46:58,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President!
Just hold on, all right? I'm coming.</font>

1619
01:46:59,623 --> 01:47:02,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just hold on. Hold on.</font>

1620
01:47:14,888 --> 01:47:16,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1621
01:47:23,730 --> 01:47:25,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye-bye.</font>

1622
01:47:36,743 --> 01:47:37,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brace yourself.</font>

1623
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:50,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look damn good, Mr. President,</font>

1624
01:47:50,924 --> 01:47:52,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'm gonna need that suit back.</font>

1625
01:48:05,981 --> 01:48:07,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The President is secure, Tony.</font>

1626
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:08,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm clearing the area.
- Nice work.</font>

1627
01:48:09,651 --> 01:48:11,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ready, sir?
- What do you mean "ready"?</font>

1628
01:48:20,078 --> 01:48:22,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pep, I got you.
Relax, I got you.</font>

1629
01:48:22,914 --> 01:48:23,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just look at me!</font>

1630
01:48:26,418 --> 01:48:28,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, I can't reach any further
and you can't stay there.</font>

1631
01:48:28,753 --> 01:48:30,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right?
You've got to let go.</font>

1632
01:48:30,672 --> 01:48:33,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got to let go!
I'll catch you, I promise.</font>

1633
01:48:36,178 --> 01:48:37,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1634
01:49:03,955 --> 01:49:07,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A shame. I would've caught her.</font>

1635
01:49:38,156 --> 01:49:39,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eject.</font>

1636
01:50:24,661 --> 01:50:26,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, here we are on the roof.</font>

1637
01:50:36,965 --> 01:50:38,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mark 42, inbound.</font>

1638
01:50:38,216 --> 01:50:41,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be damned.
The prodigal son returns.</font>

1639
01:50:57,527 --> 01:50:58,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever.</font>

1640
01:50:59,738 --> 01:51:01,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really didn't deserve her, Tony.</font>

1641
01:51:02,866 --> 01:51:06,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a pity.
I was so close to having her perfect.</font>

1642
01:51:09,414 --> 01:51:11,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait!
Slow down! Slow down!</font>

1643
01:51:11,916 --> 01:51:14,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right. I don't deserve her.</font>

1644
01:51:15,587 --> 01:51:17,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's where you're wrong.</font>

1645
01:51:17,589 --> 01:51:18,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was already perfect.</font>

1646
01:51:26,598 --> 01:51:28,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis,</font>

1647
01:51:29,267 --> 01:51:30,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do me a favour and blow Mark 42.</font>

1648
01:51:31,186 --> 01:51:32,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No...</font>

1649
01:52:46,219 --> 01:52:48,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more false faces.</font>

1650
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:50,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said you wanted the Mandarin.</font>

1651
01:52:52,142 --> 01:52:54,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're looking right at him.</font>

1652
01:52:55,186 --> 01:52:58,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was always me, Tony.
Right from the start.</font>

1653
01:52:58,690 --> 01:53:00,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am the Mandarin!</font>

1654
01:53:11,786 --> 01:53:13,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got nothing.</font>

1655
01:53:19,878 --> 01:53:22,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!</font>

1656
01:53:30,889 --> 01:53:32,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?
What, are you mad at me?</font>

1657
01:53:58,917 --> 01:54:00,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey?</font>

1658
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:06,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1659
01:54:07,592 --> 01:54:09,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was really violent.</font>

1660
01:54:10,803 --> 01:54:12,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were...</font>

1661
01:54:12,972 --> 01:54:15,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was dead.
Why? Because I fell 200 feet?</font>

1662
01:54:18,478 --> 01:54:20,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's the hot mess now?</font>

1663
01:54:20,313 --> 01:54:22,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's still debatable.</font>

1664
01:54:22,941 --> 01:54:26,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably tipping your way a little bit.
Why don't you dress like this at home?</font>

1665
01:54:26,444 --> 01:54:28,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sport bra. The whole deal.</font>

1666
01:54:28,446 --> 01:54:31,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I think I understand
why you don't want to give up the suits.</font>

1667
01:54:31,824 --> 01:54:34,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I going to complain
about now?</font>

1668
01:54:35,203 --> 01:54:36,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's me.</font>

1669
01:54:37,622 --> 01:54:38,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll think of something.</font>

1670
01:54:40,250 --> 01:54:41,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, don't touch me.
- Don't worry about it.</font>

1671
01:54:41,709 --> 01:54:43,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, I'm gonna burn you.
- No, you're not.</font>

1672
01:54:44,671 --> 01:54:45,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not hot.</font>

1673
01:54:47,090 --> 01:54:48,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I gonna be okay?</font>

1674
01:54:48,841 --> 01:54:49,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1675
01:54:49,968 --> 01:54:52,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're in a relationship with me.
Everything will never be okay.</font>

1676
01:54:52,929 --> 01:54:54,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I think I can figure this out, yeah.</font>

1677
01:54:55,014 --> 01:54:56,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I almost had this 20 years ago
when I was drunk.</font>

1678
01:54:56,808 --> 01:54:59,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I can get you better.</font>

1679
01:55:00,562 --> 01:55:03,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I do. I fix stuff.</font>

1680
01:55:03,147 --> 01:55:05,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And all your distractions?</font>

1681
01:55:06,359 --> 01:55:08,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to shave them down
a little bit.</font>

1682
01:55:08,319 --> 01:55:10,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis. Hey.</font>

1683
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:14,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All wrapped up here, sir.
Will there be anything else?</font>

1684
01:55:14,325 --> 01:55:16,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what to do.</font>

1685
01:55:16,369 --> 01:55:19,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?</font>

1686
01:55:19,205 --> 01:55:22,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.</font>

1687
01:55:58,661 --> 01:55:59,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so far?
Do you like it?</font>

1688
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:03,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It Will do.</font>

1689
01:56:12,675 --> 01:56:18,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And so, as Christmas morning began,
my journey had reached its end.</font>

1690
01:56:21,517 --> 01:56:23,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You start with something pure,</font>

1691
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:28,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">something exciting.
Then, come the mistakes.</font>

1692
01:56:29,901 --> 01:56:31,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The compromises.</font>

1693
01:56:38,117 --> 01:56:40,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We create our own demons.</font>

1694
01:56:46,084 --> 01:56:48,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great to see you! Bloody hell!</font>

1695
01:56:49,796 --> 01:56:53,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As promised, I got Pepper sorted out.
It took some tinkering.</font>

1696
01:56:53,591 --> 01:56:57,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then I thought to myself,
"Why stop there?"</font>

1697
01:57:01,224 --> 01:57:04,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, there are people who say
progress is dangerous,</font>

1698
01:57:04,644 --> 01:57:08,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'll bet none of those idiots ever
had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.</font>

1699
01:57:08,564 --> 01:57:11,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now, neither will I.</font>

1700
01:57:12,402 --> 01:57:14,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me tell you,</font>

1701
01:57:14,404 --> 01:57:16,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that was the best sleep
I'd had in years.</font>

1702
01:57:37,427 --> 01:57:39,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. It's okay.</font>

1703
01:57:39,470 --> 01:57:40,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

1704
01:57:40,596 --> 01:57:41,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, look.</font>

1705
01:58:58,883 --> 01:59:02,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if I were to wrap this up,
tie it with a bow, or whatever...</font>

1706
01:59:03,012 --> 01:59:07,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I'd say my armour,
it was never a distraction,</font>

1707
01:59:07,391 --> 01:59:09,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or a hobby.</font>

1708
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:11,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a cocoon.</font>

1709
01:59:12,772 --> 01:59:14,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now,</font>

1710
01:59:15,525 --> 01:59:17,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a changed man.</font>

1711
01:59:26,744 --> 01:59:30,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can take away my house,
and all my tricks and toys.</font>

1712
01:59:31,415 --> 01:59:34,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One thing you can't take away...</font>

1713
01:59:36,796 --> 01:59:38,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Iron Man.</font>

1714
02:09:04,405 --> 02:09:06,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, and thank you by the way.
For listening.</font>

1715
02:09:06,824 --> 02:09:09,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plus, something about getting it off
my chest,</font>

1716
02:09:09,368 --> 02:09:12,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and putting it out there in the
atmosphere instead of holding this in...</font>

1717
02:09:12,996 --> 02:09:15,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, this is what gets people sick,
you know.</font>

1718
02:09:15,791 --> 02:09:18,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, I had no idea
you were such a good listener.</font>

1719
02:09:18,919 --> 02:09:21,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be able to share
all my intimate thoughts</font>

1720
02:09:21,505 --> 02:09:22,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and my experiences with someone,</font>

1721
02:09:22,714 --> 02:09:25,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it just cuts the weight of it in half.</font>

1722
02:09:25,342 --> 02:09:26,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, it's like a snake
swallowing its own tail.</font>

1723
02:09:26,802 --> 02:09:28,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything comes full circle.</font>

1724
02:09:28,637 --> 02:09:32,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the fact that you've been able to
help me process...</font>

1725
02:09:34,601 --> 02:09:36,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you with me?
- Sorry... I was, yeah.</font>

1726
02:09:36,145 --> 02:09:37,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were at...</font>

1727
02:09:37,438 --> 02:09:38,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you actively napping?</font>

1728
02:09:38,772 --> 02:09:41,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was... I... I drifted.</font>

1729
02:09:41,525 --> 02:09:42,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did I lose you?</font>

1730
02:09:44,695 --> 02:09:46,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elevator in Switzerland.</font>

1731
02:09:47,990 --> 02:09:49,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you heard none of it.</font>

1732
02:09:49,741 --> 02:09:52,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor.</font>

1733
02:09:53,328 --> 02:09:54,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a therapist.</font>

1734
02:09:54,788 --> 02:09:56,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's not my training.
- So?</font>

1735
02:09:56,790 --> 02:09:58,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't have the...
- What? The time?</font>

1736
02:09:58,500 --> 02:09:59,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Temperament.</font>

1737
02:10:00,002 --> 02:10:01,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?
Now that I think about it...</font>

1738
02:10:01,628 --> 02:10:03,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, my original wound.</font>

1739
02:10:03,255 --> 02:10:05,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 1983, all right?
- Yes.</font>

1740
02:10:05,507 --> 02:10:08,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny.
That was weird.</font>
