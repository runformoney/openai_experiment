1
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:15,390
So my last housemate
left all of a sudden,

2
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:19,853
but, fortunately, through my work,
a position came up in Los Angeles,

3
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:23,315
so I needed to find a new housemate.

4
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,150
Hello.

5
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,863
The Grandmaster was the only one
who answered my Craigslist ad.

6
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,532
(LAUGHING)

7
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,700
Imagine that. I was the only one.

8
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,661
Well, lucky me.

9
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,664
<i>DARRYL: At first, I thought he was just
another Hollywood-type person,</i>

10
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,375
<i>then I realized he was more than likely
from another planet.</i>

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,503
I like learning about your culture.

12
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,754
Now, what do you call this?

13
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,297
- Toast.
- Yes.

14
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:51,468
I come from Sakaar.
It's a haven for lost things.

15
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,639
That sounds kind of poetic, but
it's really kind of a catch-all place.

16
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,058
And now, without boring you
with the details,

17
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,478
I had formerly,
and for rather a long period of time,

18
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:05,566
an assistant/bodyguard named Topaz.

19
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,360
And now, you know,
I'm looking for a new assistant,

20
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,697
and you know who seems
to fit the bill just perfectly?

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,448
Believe it or not, it's Darryl.

22
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:16,451
<i>DARRYL: He's starting to make me
dress up in Topaz's armor.</i>

23
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,668
<i>He's getting me to do
a lot of things for him.</i>

24
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:22,249
<i>Do the dishes, drive him around,
and also do his laundry.</i>

25
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,752
<i>He says he's over one million years old,
which I find hard to believe</i>

26
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,338
<i>because he acts quite young,
almost immature.</i>

27
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,798
<i>He is a really nice guy.</i>

28
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,359
<i>It's the first thing
I noticed about him.</i>

29
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,677
<i>He's very charming and persuasive,</i>

30
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,806
<i>but sometimes,
he completely loses his temper.</i>

31
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,892
Damn it. God damn it!

32
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,176
I don't do this for everybody,

33
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,022
but I'm going to share with you
some of the drawings that I've made

34
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,607
here in Darryl's house.

35
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,650
They're all of Darryl. Now watch this.

36
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,319
So here's the first one.

37
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,447
I gave him an extra-long tie.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

38
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,825
This is Darryl on a horse.
Oh, he's so happy.

39
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,953
And the horse has my face.
Did you notice?

40
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:04,041
That's also Darryl as a crying cyclops.

41
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,502
Oh, my golly! Well, look at this.

42
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:11,506
Here is Darryl asleep right there,

43
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:15,052
and, of course, he's dreaming about me.

44
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,055
<i>My eye fell upon him,
and then I kind of knew it right away.</i>

45
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,681
<i>He's kind of like my muse.</i>

46
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,225
<i>He just interests me strangely.</i>

47
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,854
What am I working on
at the moment? Well, um...

48
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,775
You know, I'm fixing to move in
on this new planet.

49
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,735
Now, I've kind of taken a liking to it.

50
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,821
So I'm gonna rule Earth.

51
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,783
<i>DARRYL: Lately, he's started
talking about taking over Earth.</i>

52
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:41,161
<i>I'm not sure how he would go about
starting to take over Earth,</i>

53
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,245
<i>but we made a video.</i>

54
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:47,501
Peoples of Planet Earth,
my name is Grandmaster,

55
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:52,631
and I'm about to become your ruler.

56
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:59,137
<i>Those who resist me, let me say,
will become melted.</i>

57
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,849
This is my melting stick.

58
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,104
Yeah, if people displease me,
I can melt them.

59
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,314
How many views have we got now?

60
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,525
- One.
- One? That's not bad.

61
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,444
That's just us
because we're watching it.

62
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,447
Maybe you need to refresh the window.

63
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,865
- Okay.
- Okay.

64
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,660
- And how many views do we have now?
- Now we've got two.

65
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:25,747
Ah! Good, good. Two, so we're...
Now we're in business.

66
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,041
That second one is us, too.
We've seen it twice.

67
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:32,129
We might need to make another video
advertising the original video.

68
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,006
You know anybody who can play music,
some of your work friends?

69
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,216
From the top, ready?

70
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,467
Three, four.

71

(MUSIC PLAYING)

72
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,230
Nope, nope, nope.

73
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:54,151
(CHUCKLES) Wow, David,
why are you playing a zimbeldorp

74
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,111
when we're obviously doing a zets?

75
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,404
Why are you doing that?

76
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,448
I don't know what that is.

77
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:05,954
(SIGHS)

78
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:10,292
All right, from the top.

79
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,086
One, two. One, two, three...

80
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,965
I don't wanna go to sleep
without clearing up a few things, okay?

81
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,802
I wanna apologize for melting David.

82
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:24,014
We might wanna call his parents
and just let them know.

83
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:27,100
I guess I should be the one to call.

84
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,114
But can we practice
what we're gonna say...

85
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,038
- Practice calling Mrs. Richardson?
- Yeah, yeah.

86
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,105
Okay. Ring, ring, ring.

87
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,732
- Hello?
- Hello. Who's this?

88
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,568
This is Mrs. Richardson.

89
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,279
Oh, Mrs. Richardson...

90
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,406
I'm not sure
that's the best way to start.

91
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,816
Well, let's see what happens.

92
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,243
You try to channel her...
Mrs. Richardson.

(PURRING)

94
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,332
How are you, Mrs. Richardson?
You can call me Grandmaster.

95
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,542
Mrs. Richardson, what are you wearing?

96
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,211
I'm just wearing a nightgown.

97
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,005
Oh, you've got to be kidding!
What color?

98
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,050
- Uh, blue.
- Oh!

99
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,343
That's my favorite color.

100
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,845
Mrs. Richardson, David's melted.

(MIMICS WEAPON HUMMING)

102
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,600
So you may be wondering
what will become of Darryl

103
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,893
when I take over this planet.

104
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,688
Well, he's going to, uh, rule beside me.

105
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,857
Well, he's gonna stand beside me
when I rule.

106
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,527
I'm gonna be ruling,
but he's gonna be standing beside me.

<i>DARRYL: I don't like saying this,</i>

108

<i>but you look at him,
and he stares right back at you,</i>

109
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,618
and I can't tell if he wants to just

110
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,830
hang out or melt me.

111
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,790
I love you, Darryl.

112
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,714
Do you have anything to say to that?

113
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,594
I love you, too.

114
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,139
I didn't force him to say that.

115
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,642
Um...

116
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,561
That warms me terrifically.

117
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,729
Thank you.

118
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,526
I think... I never thought I'd say this,

but I'm really beginning
to miss my old housemate.
